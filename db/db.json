You’re interested in marketing, but fascinated by growth.  You might not be very experienced yet, but you’ve probably read widely, dabbled in some web development and you’re keen on experimenting and analysing the results to really understand what’s working.  You want short feedback loops, a laser focus on growth and you don’t want to be constrained by tried and true methods.  We want that too, and our world class team is ready to give you the freedom, resources and support you need to really make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>WHAT&#39;S A JUNIOR GROWTH HACKER?</p>\n\n<p>As our junior growth hacker, you will work with our digital advertising co-ordinator, data scientists and General Improvements team to help us reach the right customers, at the right time, in the right place, with the right message – through data analysis, some technical problem solving, and a bit of creative thinking. You’ll look at the nitty gritty to give us a better idea of what’s working and what isn’t. When something isn’t working, you’ll take an active interest in figuring out why, and what might make things work better.</p>\n\n<p>You might not have much work experience under your belt – and that’s OK with us, because you’re probably familiar with this way of thinking through your time at uni, by working on your own thing, or via your insatiable consumption of blogs, articles, books and forums. We are looking for someone who is driven to learn and improve all the time, and who isn’t afraid to try new things.</p>\n\n<p>So, bring your imagination, creativity and analytical brain to Bellroy and help us grow – in return, we’ll give you a community of like minded folks, the tools and resources you need, and the autonomy you crave.

You are well aware that people interact with different social media platforms and websites in different ways, and you’re curious to figure out what that means from a brand perspective. You can look at a whole mess of data and then turn your mind around to how it relates in human, real-world contexts. You eagerly seek to understand how an algorithm works, so you can feed it the right information to get the best result. Numbers and complexity don’t scare you. Instead, they inspire you to find innovative solutions to complicated problems.</p>\n\n<p>You believe that great products can make a positive impact on people’s lives and you take pleasure in getting the right information in front of them to help them make the best choice. You’re not interested in selling people things they don’t want, or using sales tactics that are anything but genuine. Instead, you want to bring great things to new people in interesting ways.</p>\n\n<p>You’re technically literate. You may have started with technical interests or come to them as you began to explore what computers could do for you. However you got there, you’re now able to write simple programs, or at least know what tools you’d use to get a basic website up and running and integrate some external services with it. You love understanding how technology works, and thinking about how you can use it to make things easier, faster and better.</p>\n\n<p>And at the end of the day, you’re super keen to keep learning.

You could be a recent graduate or have 15 years experience - what&rsquo;s important to us is demonstrable ability and brains.</p><br /><p>Our product is composed of two main parts:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>The hardware - a custom designed PCB 'controller' including custom firmware written in C++</li><br /><li>The software - a .NET based control system designed to safely manage thousands of controllers</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Primarily we need engineers with .NET experience who are familiar with the entire stack including including C# 6, WPF, WCF, LINQ, Async, BCL etc. Familiarity with Git, SQL, PowerShell, NuGet, NHibernate, TeamCity, MSBuild, Windows (server, management, deployment, permissions, diagnostics etc.) and communications &amp; protocol design are also desirable. You would definitely need to have some experience of unit testing using technologies such as Nunit. If you constantly sing the praises of Resharper you would fit in well round here. HTTP, RESTful principles, and a good understanding of architectural and software patterns would also be cool. We are considering rewriting our UI as a browser app in the near future so any relevant skills you could bring there would be an advantage.&nbsp; And lastly, a passion for the latest ideas &amp; innovations in our industry would be good.</p><br /><p>Your work would be directed by an experienced engineer, who could become both your mentor and/or your student, depending on what experience you bring to the party. For the team to all get along you would need to have an agile mindset, not to mention a good sense of humour. His bookshelf has got things on it like &ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Mythical Man Month&rdquo;, &ldquo;Code complete&rdquo;, &ldquo;Windows Internals&rdquo;, and &ldquo;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&rdquo;. If you are familiar with any of those you will probably get on well around here. We try to use Kanban to plan our work, and try not to over-engineer. We try to refactor as we go and are open to investing in better tools and approaches when we see opportunities. Broken builds get punished with a harsh stare, especially if it happens on a Friday night. Unit testing is a [wonderful] tool not a universal prescription. The same applies to pair programming.</p><br /><p>As it's still a small company, this is an opportunity to learn everything that goes on behind the scenes. You'll likely be listening in on (or get involved in) meetings about about everything from project planning, industrial design, PCD engineering, power plants, steam turbines, sales, suppliers and manufacturing. You may also be required occasionally to sign for deliveries or buy milk...so, yes, you really do need to have a startup mentality. If you want freedom to provide input on business decisions and take risks (where appropriate!) this is the place for you. If you just want the simple life working from dull&nbsp;specification documents it probably isn&rsquo;t.</p><br /><p>Our current office is modest but in an amazing location, slap bang in the middle of Surry Hills - one of Sydney's most beautiful suburbs - surrounded by some of the city's best cafes and restaurants. We plan to upgrade to a larger office in the vicinity sometime over the next 6 months in anticipation of a rapid expansion of the company over the next 2 years. There has recently been an announcement in the news for a $1.2bn solar power plant which we may or may not be involved with :) Because of that, and other opportunities globally, you might have the option of some international travel.</p><br /><p>Working on&nbsp;commercializing renewable energy technology?&nbsp;Gotta be better working for a bank, surely.</p><br /><p>Fine print:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><span>Role is local only</span></li><br /><li><span>Must have right to work in Australia</span></li><br /></ul>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/118941/net-software-engineer-renewable-energy-device-logic-pty-ltd","source":"stackoverflow","location":"Surry Hills, Australia","tags":["engineer",".net"]},{"date":1469068888000,"title":"Senior Software Engineer","company":"RedMart","content":"<p><strong>As a Senior Software Engineer you will:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Play a critical role in a cross-functional team of talented software engineers and product managers that has full ownership of our Marketplace seller experience.

Exceptional writing and editing skills with an ability to adopt different writing styles tone, and voice (a journalism degree would be a plus) \n2. Attention to detail, competency and professionalism is critical\n3. HubSpot certification and experience is a plus for the application and will be required for the role\n4. Ability to work remotely, think independently and be solution oriented \n\n**Additional notes or requirements**\nInitially, this is an hourly, freelance role (first 90 days) with 20-30 hours per week, and time tracked with Harvest software.

For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab\">Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing\"> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong><br /></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. As I write this, Taylor (our CTO) is in, London or Brazil, or maybe back in Austin? Not all of us travel so extensively, but the fact that he does is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul. There’s no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong><br /></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. This year it was a <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong\">gigantic cabin in the mountains</a>. The time before that<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343\"> it was in Costa Rica</a>. &nbsp;We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Up Your Game</strong></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people grow. &nbsp;</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong><br /></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Brazil, Canada, and all over the United States.) For this particular role though, please pay attention to the timezone requirements above.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong><br /></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of the above awesomeness?)</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Other Tidbits</strong><br /></div><ul><li>We do birthday and Christmas gifts: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer...</strong><br /></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: </strong></div><div>As a visual designer at YNAB you’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and web updates while maintaining and expanding the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside UX designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across all our platforms including upgrades to product UI and educational projects. You will be on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail and will shepherd your designs through development.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You’ve made our CEO cry twice. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your organized documentation of brand guidelines and strict approach to file management. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers. Basic awareness of HTML and CSS is a must. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Bonus Points: </strong><br /></div><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB. </li><li>You have one or more of the following skills: Motion graphics, video, illustration. </li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> Apply through this link: <a href=\"https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk06r53\">https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk06r53</a>.
