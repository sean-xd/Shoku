We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. This year it was a <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong\">gigantic cabin in the mountains</a>. The time before that<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343\"> it was in Costa Rica</a>. &nbsp;We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Up Your Game</strong></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft.

For this particular role though, please pay attention to the timezone requirements above.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong><br /></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of the above awesomeness?)</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Other Tidbits</strong><br /></div><ul><li>We do birthday and Christmas gifts: No gift cards here.

You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences. You will change lives.

As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside UX designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across all our platforms including upgrades to product UI and educational projects. You will be on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail and will shepherd your designs through development.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You’ve made our CEO cry twice. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your organized documentation of brand guidelines and strict approach to file management. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers. Basic awareness of HTML and CSS is a must. </div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Bonus Points: </strong><br /></div><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB. </li><li>You have one or more of the following skills: Motion graphics, video, illustration. </li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> Apply through this link: <a href=\"https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk06r53\">https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk06r53</a>.

We're looking for a Software Developer to join our growing development team. If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in great environment with great people, this is your chance. We&rsquo;re a security software-as-a-service company so you&rsquo;ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Ok. &nbsp;Who are you guys?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We&rsquo;re Wombat Security Technologies. We&rsquo;re comprised of a some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What would I be working on?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> You know all those data breaches your hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You&rsquo;ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help.Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Can you tell me a little more about your product?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess the their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and cutting-edge attacks, this is the where to do it. You&rsquo;ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Where is this position located?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA where our HQ office is located in the Strip District. But don&rsquo;t let that fool you--we don&rsquo;t value butts in seats over productivity.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> You&rsquo;ll be working on a key component that have high value and visibility to the organization. It&rsquo;s a polyglot environment but you&rsquo;ll do mostly java but you&rsquo;ll also work on our web app using javascript and ember.js. You&rsquo;ll keep in touch with the team using Slack, Google Hangouts, and even an ol' IP phone if you&rsquo;d prefer.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What tools do I have at my disposal?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> Whatever enables you to do your best work (Within reason. A Tesla won&rsquo;t help your write code faster, sorry). Most of our developers use a Mac or an Ubuntu laptop.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What hours will I work?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We work typical office hours &mdash; &nbsp;but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We&rsquo;re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we all have families so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.</p><br /><p><br><strong>Q: What technology do you use?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What benefits do you offer?</strong></p><br /><p>A: The salary is competitive and depends on your experience.

Auth0 is looking for SDK engineers to help drive the end-to-end developer experience for various languages and platforms. This is more than just writing code, this is about making sure everyone who uses Auth0 has an amazing experience.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We are looking for somebody who can balance technical requirements, customer needs, and data to constantly drive improvement. In any given day you might handle anything from adding new functionality to an SDK, creating a sample, writing technical documentation, or even jumping in and helping a customer solve a really tough problem. You will be the go to person for a particular language/framework at Auth0.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>The areas you will focus on are:</strong></div><ul><li>Creating and maintain our core SDKs. This will include anything from adding new features, updating when new versions of frameworks are released, to fixing bugs reported by customers. You will be responsible for the quality and completeness of the SDKs you oversee.</li><li>Write end-to-end documentation for your language/framework. At Auth0 we believe that if the customer can't figure out an answer then we need to do better. Your job will be to always improve the docs to make the experience better for our customers. We want security to be easy, you will help make it so.</li><li>Create meaningful samples that show best practices using Auth0.

You like learning new skills and applying your existing skills to make things happen.</li><li><strong>Completionist</strong> - You ship code. Getting a feature out to our customers today is better than getting it out tomorrow. You should drive to ship each and every day. You should have a history of shipping.</li><li><strong>Detail Oriented</strong> - Youâll need to understand the big picture, but also be keenly aware of the details. When it comes to shipping SDKs and developer docs the details make or break the experience. A simple missing step or line of code can be the difference between a customer loving or leaving our product. You should be the type of person who cares deeply about the details.</li><li><strong>Problem Solver</strong> - You can figure out a problem with little or no guidance. We hire explorers and doers. Given a problem you dive in and find the answer. When presented a challenge you immediately start to think of several solutions. You can't reset until you find the best answer.</li><li><strong>Highly Technical</strong> - You will be the go to person on a particular technology. You are the authority. You need to understand the how and the why. In this role you will need to solve real-world problems, and as such you need to have experience building and shipping real products.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Technical Skills:</strong></div><div>We are looking for people who have expertise with the following languages/frameworks.
