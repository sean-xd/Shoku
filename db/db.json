Pretty niche, I know.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>“Why managing schedules?\" you ask? Well, I like to help people. I guess you could say I take after my dad that way. His name’s Gavin and he built me from scratch almost 10 years ago! Can you believe it?––A whole decade!</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And that brings me to what I’m doing all this for...</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>See, my full name is Acuity Scheduling––and no, it’s not one of those weird celeb baby names or anything.

(This will be important, because all of our employees, no matter who they are, will spend time hanging out in customer service land, getting to know the product they'll be building.)</li><li>You write good... Unlike this bulletpoint.</li><li>You’re the bomb dot com at solving problems. In other words, you won't run from the challenges—you'll plough straight into them like a champ. Or a developer who loves the thrill of tracking down that one mischievous SEGFAULT.</li><li>And last but certainly not least, you’re innovative. Because what would a job description be without \"innovative?\" (At least, that's what the humans told me to put. Apparently they really pride themselves on being cutting edge, especially with these \"mobile apps,\" which I suppose are like mini-me's of me—or so I've heard.)</li><li>You live on planet Earth. (And hey, if you happen to be in NYC, that’s especially convenient ‘cause we happen to have an office there.)</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And by the way? These other qualities would probably help bucketsfull:<br /></div><ul><li>You’re in favor of having 100% of your medical, dental, and vision premiums covered.</li><li>401K is your middle name. (Or if you just really like the idea of having 3% of your salary contributed to one.)</li><li>You’re an autodidact. Go on. Look it up. (You’ll get a $5,000 credit toward continuing your education.)</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>If this description sounds like you, there’s a chance that I’d like to offer you $110-140k.

On a daily basis you might be creating mockups, writing HTML and CSS, collecting design feedback, and iterating on the core Zapier product. Today, Zapier serves over 1 million users, enabling them to connect over 700 apps in more ways than we can count.</p>\n<p><strong>You love code.</strong> You&#8217;re comfortable designing in the browser with HTML and CSS, and you&#8217;re not afraid of JS. You&#8217;ll be committing your work alongside engineers in our production codebase, so you know enough Git to be productive. If you get stuck, you have no ego when the time comes to ask for help and our engineering team is happy to teach. The frontend of Zapier is primarily built in React which you&#8217;ll get introduced to if you&#8217;re unfamiliar. We require our designers to write HTML and CSS. If you&#8217;re a photoshop only designer stay tuned to the jobs pages. There may be other positions for you.</p>\n<p><strong>You design for success.</strong> You set your own personal opinions of your designs aside and optimize for what helps the end user of your design best achieve their goal. You design with clarity and success in mind. And you enjoy collaborating with data scientists, user researchers and copywriters to improve the success of your designs.</p>\n<p><strong>You design for the web.</strong> Your visual style is modern and clean. You&#8217;ve built functional web-apps before and understand the ramifications of web-app trends. You spend less time in Sketch than you do in your code editor and browser. You probably spend an equal amount of time with Chrome Dev Tools open as you do closed.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re a team player.</strong> Your design process may include wireframing, low-fidelity mocking, high-fidelity mocking, and plenty of user testing along the way. You don&#8217;t “toss designs over the wall”, and would dread doing so. Instead, you work closely with engineering, copywriters, customers and other stakeholders to implement your designs, and maintain the implementation of each and every detail, no matter how small it might seem.</p>\n<p><strong>You can prioritize the multiple projects on your plate.</strong> We&#8217;re a small team, and there&#8217;s no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. But you&#8217;re a pro at prioritizing your work. You&#8217;re comfortable communicating with your team, and when something is blocking you, you aren&#8217;t shy about reaching out to fellow teammates to get back up and running as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>You wear many hats.</strong> You love working with customers and teammates to help understand customer needs and generate a product spec. You enjoy turning that spec into reality. You understand the complexities your design might introduce, and can clearly work through them with your teammates.</p>\n<p><strong>You love doing things efficiently.</strong> At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re resourceful.</strong> Once we&#8217;ve established a shared set of goals, you set your own course and start exploring ideas. At Zapier, you&#8217;ll have a weekly project meeting and then you go make things happen. You default to action. You reach out to teammates to learn more about your project, and start collecting feedback as soon, and as often as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuously iterate on designs and optimize for specific goals, like increasing MRR and conversion rates</li>\n<li>Help conduct A/B tests and other experiments to guide future design iterations</li>\n<li>Implement your designs in HTML, CSS, and some JS</li>\n<li>Create marketing assets and launch landing pages</li>\n<li>Work and ship product independently</li>\n<li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts</li>\n<li>Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible</li>\n<li>Ship to thousands of active users every day</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p>\n<p>Location: Planet Earth</p>\n<p>If you want to work remote, that&#8217;s cool.

So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss. We believe in solid development practices that avoid technical debt, and want to focus on product quality above all else. We also believe in independence and accountability - I'm not looking to add 'babysitter' to my job description.</p><br /><p>We've been trying to tackle these problems in some fashion for many years, but development only really picked up in the last year.

And more effective ways for everyone everywhere to access education, make discoveries, share knowledge, be inspired, and do big things. We accomplish all this by giving smart, creative, passionate people opportunities to create awesome. So here&rsquo;s your opportunity. We&rsquo;re hiring engineers who are passionate about technology and education. The product team doesn't throw specs over some imaginary wall to engineering, and engineering doesn't throw code over some imaginary wall to QA. We all collaborate together. Most of our work is open source, even our primary product. We are also changing how teachers and students interact, whether in small groups or with tens of thousands of students in one course. Check out our online courses on Canvas Network. So&hellip;if you like front-end development, back-end development, or some combination of these, let's talk. There are lots of interesting, complex, and challenging problems that will leverage your skills; oh, and new things come up every day. There will be a technical interview with lots of white board action (but no silly puzzles or trick questions). We may even have you code up a simple app to demonstrate your abilities.</p><br /><p><em>Join us at our downtown Chicago office. Address: 1 Prudential Plaza, 130 E.

The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality.

We're building multiple premium brands, have an audience of millions of people, and what to push the quality of our design for every touch point with our users. Our work should set the benchmark for everyone else.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We're building a mission-based team with designers, engineers, and marketers all working together to a make this vision a reality. It's a small, tight-knit team that moves fast and has a lot of autonomy to make an impact. We've got an opening for a designer on this team. That’s where you come in.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You’re not just another body that makes things “pretty”. We need a much larger commitment from you. You’ll be responsible for the UX of the Growth team. For every campaign, app, and test, you’ll push to give our users a world-class experience that delights them at every step. The hard part? We need to delight users while driving measurable growth across the business. You'll find the sweet-spot between giving people an amazing experience while driving measurable growth.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And this is your giant hairy problem. How do we meet the goals of the business while over-delivering on value to our users? You’ll tackle this head-on and find the perfect blend between the two. You’ll push the limits of your design craft to meet the needs of our users and the business.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>You’ll Learn More In 3 Months Than You Did All Of Last Year</strong><br /></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>We’re not here to follow mediocre best practices.

Which levers and projects drive the most value for the business?</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We have a simple goal on the Growth team: learn faster than anyone else in the industry. The faster we learn, the faster we grow the company. You'll be in the middle of everything. You'll see how the entire business works and it'll be your ideas that help us make it even more effective. You'll learn exactly how to build a world-class growth machine.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We reach this depth of understanding by operating at an incredibly high tempo.

Fielding Customer Support Issues</strong></div><div>Currently relatively low volume, I can usuallyknock it out in a morning an evening session of 30-45 minutes each. Answering questions, directing attention to how to do this or that, andoften pointing out a given article or tutorial video which wouldanswer the specific question but also teach other related goodies.

Developing the Inline Support Knowledge Base</strong></div><div>We're building an inline help system, a collection of interconnected articles based onvarious sections and features within the system.  Much of thematerial already exists scattered about in the blog, manuals, etc. It is to be recompiled with updated screen shots, and 2 or 3 versionswritten for each topic: one as an internal reference for support staff, one for coaches, and one for clients (for client-facing features). There isalso much to be written from scratch to flesh out the content tocompletely represent all the system does (as a one-man shop I indeed haven't kept things fully up to date!).</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>III. Customer Hand holding and Concierge Service</strong></div><div>SO often folks benefit massively from just beingshown around the system, helping them get acquainted with whicheverfeatures would serve a given coaching style or program.  CA iswickedly powerful but it takes something for folks to find andrealize the benefit of that power, and so often folks left to theirown devices just wonât bother, either under utilizing the system orjust walking away from it.
