On a daily basis you might be creating mockups, writing HTML and CSS, collecting design feedback, and iterating on the core Zapier product. Today, Zapier serves over 1 million users, enabling them to connect over 700 apps in more ways than we can count.</p>\n<p><strong>You love code.</strong> You&#8217;re comfortable designing in the browser with HTML and CSS, and you&#8217;re not afraid of JS. You&#8217;ll be committing your work alongside engineers in our production codebase, so you know enough Git to be productive. If you get stuck, you have no ego when the time comes to ask for help and our engineering team is happy to teach. The frontend of Zapier is primarily built in React which you&#8217;ll get introduced to if you&#8217;re unfamiliar. We require our designers to write HTML and CSS. If you&#8217;re a photoshop only designer stay tuned to the jobs pages. There may be other positions for you.</p>\n<p><strong>You design for success.</strong> You set your own personal opinions of your designs aside and optimize for what helps the end user of your design best achieve their goal. You design with clarity and success in mind. And you enjoy collaborating with data scientists, user researchers and copywriters to improve the success of your designs.</p>\n<p><strong>You design for the web.</strong> Your visual style is modern and clean. You&#8217;ve built functional web-apps before and understand the ramifications of web-app trends. You spend less time in Sketch than you do in your code editor and browser. You probably spend an equal amount of time with Chrome Dev Tools open as you do closed.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re a team player.</strong> Your design process may include wireframing, low-fidelity mocking, high-fidelity mocking, and plenty of user testing along the way. You don&#8217;t “toss designs over the wall”, and would dread doing so. Instead, you work closely with engineering, copywriters, customers and other stakeholders to implement your designs, and maintain the implementation of each and every detail, no matter how small it might seem.</p>\n<p><strong>You can prioritize the multiple projects on your plate.</strong> We&#8217;re a small team, and there&#8217;s no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. But you&#8217;re a pro at prioritizing your work. You&#8217;re comfortable communicating with your team, and when something is blocking you, you aren&#8217;t shy about reaching out to fellow teammates to get back up and running as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>You wear many hats.</strong> You love working with customers and teammates to help understand customer needs and generate a product spec. You enjoy turning that spec into reality. You understand the complexities your design might introduce, and can clearly work through them with your teammates.</p>\n<p><strong>You love doing things efficiently.</strong> At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re resourceful.</strong> Once we&#8217;ve established a shared set of goals, you set your own course and start exploring ideas. At Zapier, you&#8217;ll have a weekly project meeting and then you go make things happen. You default to action. You reach out to teammates to learn more about your project, and start collecting feedback as soon, and as often as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuously iterate on designs and optimize for specific goals, like increasing MRR and conversion rates</li>\n<li>Help conduct A/B tests and other experiments to guide future design iterations</li>\n<li>Implement your designs in HTML, CSS, and some JS</li>\n<li>Create marketing assets and launch landing pages</li>\n<li>Work and ship product independently</li>\n<li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts</li>\n<li>Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible</li>\n<li>Ship to thousands of active users every day</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p>\n<p>Location: Planet Earth</p>\n<p>If you want to work remote, that&#8217;s cool.

You discover Marco is working on a story which is becoming more and more complex, so you help him keeping things simple and at the same time aligned better with the business case. After the stand up you sit beside Rafael who is having troubles working on a Google Analytics API client. You try to understand what is exactly the problem and with your help, Rafael come up with a new approach on how to solve the problem.</p><br /><p>You meet a candidate over lunch. You aren&rsquo;t looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality match with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It&rsquo;s your shot at filtering out candidates that don&rsquo;t fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now. Of course, your senior team members will pick her apart technically later.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon, you have a face to face sync with Rafael. You ask if the new approach for the API client is working. Then you talk about what he will be focusing on the upcoming months. He has no clear idea about that and so you ask him questions about which epic motivates him the most and which task he prefers. Rafael has a clearer idea now about his focus and he will think how to keep attention in this.&nbsp;<br>Since you have no more meetings in the day, you propose a table tennis tournament with the whole team. The team loves that and even if you lose all of the matches, you have a great time.<br><br><strong>Team</strong><br>You'll work with one or two cross functional teams formed by backend and frontend Developers, UX designers and a Scrum Master.

At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.</p><br /><p>Firefly is a highly-regarded learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn.

You&rsquo;ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.</li><br /><li>clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what&rsquo;s going on and what&rsquo;s planned, you&rsquo;ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what&rsquo;s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we&rsquo;re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.</p><br /><p>In terms of experience, we have one essential requirement:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are comfortable with iOS or a web platform.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you&rsquo;ll need to know these or be able to pick them up.&nbsp;We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting</li><br /><li>Knowledge and experience of infrastructure automation</li><br /><li>Detailed knowledge of databases, particularly SQL Server</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience. All of Firefly participate in a yearly bonus scheme based on the success of the business and their contribution. We&rsquo;re committed to everyone&rsquo;s professional development, so we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending training courses or other events. In development, we have a weekly lunch-and-learn to hear about new topics and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.</p><br /><p>So, if you&rsquo;ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We're small, which means we can stay close to our clients and develop and improve our products very quickly to meet their needs. It also means you'll get great exposure to all of the things that go on in a fast growing business, and have a chance to have a big impact very quickly. We're also quite a close-knit team, so we're keen to find somebody with good social skills who would enjoy and thrive in this environment.

So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss.

For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.</p><br /><p><strong>T</strong>est-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use \"lack of time\" as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.</p><br /><p>You are a <strong>team player</strong>. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.</p><br /><p>As a <strong>passionate</strong> developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.</p><br /><p>As part of the learning process, you consider it important to <strong>share</strong> what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.</p><br /><p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job <strong>without being religious&nbsp;</strong>about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework.

While we don't feel wise enough to define where this point may be, we feel the right candidate will be adventurous enough to focus more on how to provide the strongest and cleanest user experience. We're seeking someone familiar with Rails and JavaScript who is interested in creating beautiful and functional work. Compose will lead you to opportunities to learn and grow, while providing excellent conventions (like our internal framework Megatron) to comfortably work within.\r\n\r\nAs an Application Developer with Compose, you'll make major contributions to the design, function and user experience of our product. You will join a talented and supportive team in a self-managing and open organization. We're remote first and have a diverse group of friendly people located all over the world. We'll give you the respect, freedom, and trust to contribute your talents in a way that you envision.\r\n\r\nWith great respect/freedom/trust comes great responsibility, and as such it will be crucial that you have the right intrinsic motivators to work with little direction and oversight but still collaborate and seek alternative view-points. If you love making beautiful and functional things and want to have some fun, we'd love to see what you can cook up for us.\r\n\r\n__Technical things we hope you're good at (or can become excellent at):__\r\n\r\n* Rails and JavaScript: Fluent in Rails/JavaScript. We use a lot of Go within our infrastructure, but this role doesn't require it. An idiomatic and structured approach to your work is appreciated.\r\n* Utility: You'll run into bugs. A handy stable of useful tools and a keen eye for broken things is essential.\r\n* API: A pragmatic and thorough understanding of API as a database-like source of data.\r\n* Testing: Able to write tests and specs for new features and offer insight to improve existing specs.\r\n* Databases: We provide Databases-as-a-Service; a solid fundamental understanding of good practices and various management systems would be helpful.\r\n* Security: Awareness of security vulnerabilities and protection techniques.\r\n\r\n__We're excited to see what sort of character will wind up in this role... a few helpful traits include:__\r\n\r\n* Imagination: Inject your character, vision, and perhaps even whimsy into our product.\r\n* Self Starter: We're an organization filled with people who self-manage. You get the respect and responsibility to operate with minimal supervision and management. Loose structure is not for everyone.\r\n* Detail Oriented: You'll need to work with precision... and enjoy a nice and tricky edge case.\r\n\r\n__Company Benefits__\r\n\r\nCompose is a close-knit, family-like team. We're proud of what we create. Here are some of the perks that you'll receive joining our team:\r\n\r\n* Competitive salary and excellent benefits\r\n* Flexible hours\r\n* Vacation when you need it\r\n* Amazing benefits\r\n* Talented and relaxed peers\r\n* Remote first\r\n* Fair and objective hiring\r\n\r\n__Office Locations__\r\n\r\nOur two main offices are located in San Francisco, California and Birmingham, Alabama, with remote employees in South Africa, Canada, London and many places in between.","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/18483","source":"remoteok","tags":["javascript","developer","rails"]}],"latest":1470926211000},{"name":"Teamwork.com","jobs":[{"date":1470925679000,"title":"Teamwork Projects Software Developer","company":"Teamwork.com","content":"<p><strong>Our Technical Stack</strong></p><br /><p>Don't be deterred if you are not familiar with everything in our tech stack or if you feel as though you are stronger in one area than another.

It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.

We're building multiple premium brands, have an audience of millions of people, and what to push the quality of our design for every touch point with our users. Our work should set the benchmark for everyone else.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We're building a mission-based team with designers, engineers, and marketers all working together to a make this vision a reality. It's a small, tight-knit team that moves fast and has a lot of autonomy to make an impact. We've got an opening for a designer on this team. That’s where you come in.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You’re not just another body that makes things “pretty”. We need a much larger commitment from you. You’ll be responsible for the UX of the Growth team. For every campaign, app, and test, you’ll push to give our users a world-class experience that delights them at every step. The hard part? We need to delight users while driving measurable growth across the business. You'll find the sweet-spot between giving people an amazing experience while driving measurable growth.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And this is your giant hairy problem. How do we meet the goals of the business while over-delivering on value to our users? You’ll tackle this head-on and find the perfect blend between the two. You’ll push the limits of your design craft to meet the needs of our users and the business.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>You’ll Learn More In 3 Months Than You Did All Of Last Year</strong><br /></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>We’re not here to follow mediocre best practices. We want to deeply understand what drives a business forward. Which variables matter? How do we persuade people to take action? Which levers and projects drive the most value for the business?</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We have a simple goal on the Growth team: learn faster than anyone else in the industry. The faster we learn, the faster we grow the company. You'll be in the middle of everything. You'll see how the entire business works and it'll be your ideas that help us make it even more effective. You'll learn exactly how to build a world-class growth machine.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We reach this depth of understanding by operating at an incredibly high tempo. Our iteration and feedback loops happen at a blistering pace. Testing combined with an intense tempo means you’ll learn faster than any of your peers.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>You’ll work on projects like:</strong><br /></div><ul><li>Variants for A/B testing across every step of our funnels.</li><li>Launching new landing pages for campaigns.</li><li>Working with our engineers to build light-weight freemium tools for our audience.</li><li>Improving our student apps to show them the value of living a Rich Life.</li><li>Building new funnels and signup flows.</li><li>Other marketing odds and ends (social profiles, PPC ads, email designs, etc).</li></ul><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><strong>What We're Looking For:</strong><br /></div><ul><li>Design skills that drive conversions and actions. This is not a branding team, this is an acquisition team.</li><li>Can start with just an idea, turn it into a polished design, and handle most of the front-end. We have engineers that can handle the heavy lifting and back-end but the closer you can get your work ready for production, the more projects we'll ship, and the larger your impact will be.</li><li>This is not an entry-level design position, you'll need to know how to drive projects and hold our team to a high design standard.</li><li>Growth projects are HIGHLY iterative. Many ideas won’t work. This means you’ll put your heart and soul into projects which will flop on a regular basis. That’s the nature of the work. But you need to be able to tackle the next iteration with as much gusto and passion as you did the first time. The magic doesn’t happen on launch day, it happens in the countless iterations that follow.</li><li>You should love design but you should love results more.</li><li>Our team moves at an exceptionally high tempo, you'll be shipping weekly if not daily. You'll need to find that perfect balance between high quality design and getting a project shipped.</li><li>Comfortable de-scoping to meet deadlines. Short deadlines and a high tempo mean we can't do everything.

Fielding Customer Support Issues</strong></div><div>Currently relatively low volume, I can usuallyknock it out in a morning an evening session of 30-45 minutes each. Answering questions, directing attention to how to do this or that, andoften pointing out a given article or tutorial video which wouldanswer the specific question but also teach other related goodies.

Developing the Inline Support Knowledge Base</strong></div><div>We're building an inline help system, a collection of interconnected articles based onvarious sections and features within the system.  Much of thematerial already exists scattered about in the blog, manuals, etc. It is to be recompiled with updated screen shots, and 2 or 3 versionswritten for each topic: one as an internal reference for support staff, one for coaches, and one for clients (for client-facing features). There isalso much to be written from scratch to flesh out the content tocompletely represent all the system does (as a one-man shop I indeed haven't kept things fully up to date!).</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>III. Customer Hand holding and Concierge Service</strong></div><div>SO often folks benefit massively from just beingshown around the system, helping them get acquainted with whicheverfeatures would serve a given coaching style or program.
