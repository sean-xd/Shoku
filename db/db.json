It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.

And let’s be honest, it’s never a bad gig to work from home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Robert Davis – Senior Web Developer</p>\n","url":"https://www.wfh.io/jobs/3103-full-stack-web-developer-mwi","source":"wfhio","tags":["developer","designer","full stack","manager"]},{"date":1468204272000,"title":"Web Developer","company":"Tighten","content":"<p><strong>Who We&#39;re Looking For</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re looking for a “full-stack” developer. To us that means a developer with a mixture of frontend skills (with technologies like JavaScript, SPA frameworks like Ember or Angular or VueJS, and responsive CSS and Sass/LESS) and backend skills (PHP, preferably Laravel, Slim, Craft, etc.)​</p>\n\n<p>Our backend code is primarily written in PHP, so while familiarity with Ruby, Python, Go, or other backend languages is valuable, our bread and butter is in modern, Object-Oriented PHP. The person we’re looking for feels at home in PHP, and should have at least some familiarity with the Laravel framework.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking for someone with mature, well-formed opinions about modern coding processes and practices. Someone who cares deeply about doing amazing work. Someone who is confident in their skills, but experienced enough to know that they still have a ton to learn.</p>\n\n<p>This position is especially suited for someone who&#39;s been developing long enough to develop a mature understanding of how to relate to clients, and with a diverse set of skills. It&#39;s OK if you don&#39;t have every line of Laravel&#39;s source code memorized--we&#39;d prefer you know a little bit of everything, and it&#39;s more important that you know how to approach your tasks well and learn new skills quickly.</p>\n\n<p>We’re looking for a good person. Someone with humility, integrity, a good sense of humor, and a grown-up’s sense of what matters in life.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Must-Haves​​</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>​​​​​Live in U.S./Canada</li>\n<li>Solid understanding of Object Oriented Design</li>\n<li>Considerable experience with PHP, Git, and MySQL</li>\n<li>Familiarity with Laravel Framework</li>\n<li>Basic server administration experience</li>\n<li>Experience using Bootstrap and/or Foundation, as well as LESS and/or Sass</li>\n<li>Love for clean, standards-compliant, well-tested, well-patterned code</li>\n<li>Reference a dog or a breed of dog somewhere in your application</li>\n<li>Passion for software development, learning, and growing your craft</li>\n<li>Experience interacting maturely with clients</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>​Nice-to-have</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>5+ years in a professional development capacity​</li>\n<li>Experience with functional programming</li>\n<li>Experience implementing responsive frontend code</li>\n<li>Familiarity with Craft CMS &amp; Statamic</li>\n<li>Familiarity with TDD &amp; PHPUnit</li>\n<li>Familiarity with continuous integration</li>\n<li>Experience developing RESTful APIs</li>\n<li>Experience with modern front-end frameworks such as Ember, Angular, VueJS, Backbone, etc.</li>\n<li>Experience with Vagrant, Continuous Delivery/Deployment, Linux admin, and server configuration</li>\n<li>Experience with mobile app development and deployment ​</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Why should you consider us?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We’re a small but growing company with a desire to do good things alongside our clients, write beautiful code, and solve problems creatively and effectively.</p>\n\n<p>We are constantly learning and refining our techniques and processes, and we love to think deeply about code, technology, and experience. Each project is an opportunity for us to grow—as a team, as developers, as managers, as people.</p>\n\n<p>​We place a huge emphasis on people and relationships. We love our work, but we don’t think work should necessarily be “hard” or out of balance with the rest of our lives. We believe that doing things that bring us joy outside of the office makes us better workers, and better people.</p>\n\n<p>​​We also believe in cultivating a lighthearted, jovial, and fun work environment. Since our entire team is geographically distributed, we go out of our way to create a positive work culture. We have a ridiculous amount of fun pasting absurd GIFs in our Slack chatroom, which is just one of the great software tools that allow us to recruit and retain people from all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>​We can say with great confidence that everyone on our team is a good, honest, and thoughtful person, and that’s something we’re proud of.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>​Benefits</strong></p>\n\n<p>​* Remote work\n​* Health/Dental/Vision insurance\n​* 401K retirement plan with employer match\n* 3 weeks paid time off and paid holidays\n* Consistent and reasonable working hours\n* Desk, computer, chair, and whatever else you need for an effective, healthy work environment​</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Our Company</strong></p>\n\n<p>​Tighten is a close-knit team of developers, product designers, and strategists headed by Dan Sheetz and Matt Stauffer.

Also during this phase, he/she will facilitate an Operational Review between development and the production support teams and a Security Review between development and the security team(s).</p><br /><p>Testing:</p><br /><p>In the Testing Phase, the System Architect reviews performance test data. &nbsp;He/She will design and facilitate operational recoverability testing with the Test Engineers, DBA&rsquo;s and SAs. These results are used to validate the design against the requirements established in the initial phases. He/She is the SME for the infrastructure and helps identify any design performance/availability issues. He/she works with Engineering to address infrastructure gaps found during testing and creates CRs for development to address code-related issues. The output of this phase is the Run Book describing the various points of failure and failover mechanisms.</p><br /><p>Implementation:</p><br /><p>In the Implementation Phase, the System Architect works with Technical Operations to do last minute checks to &nbsp;ensure all components are available and functioning as designed (connectivity &nbsp;between systems, port definitions, etc).

IT has always been asked to do more with less, to improve its integration with business goals and to ensure the ongoing quality of IT services. With the rise of mobile technology, the cloud and an \"app\" mentality, IT is being asked to do all that and more at breakneck speed. While devices and applications are being introduced faster than ever before, it is the service behind the technology that is still most important to the customer. As a result, IT will always need to manage its services and IT Service management (ITSM) practices and processes will always be necessary. The challenge is adapting service management practices to changing times so they can enable IT to go faster and deliver more ongoing value to the customer.</p><br /><p>Processes are even more critical than before for the success of our IT organization:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>They help facilitate a common understanding of the current environment we are working in. Although this may seem superfluous to some, formally documenting the processes currently used within the organization will lead to many interesting conversations about how things should really work and, ultimately, to a shared understanding of exactly what we are engaged in and how we execute our day-to-day work.</li><br /><li>They help to identify areas of improvement either through targeted automation or wide-scale process reengineering.</li><br /><li>They help identify problem areas that the organization doesn't yet address or that the organization is very weak in.</li><br /><li>They provide important information to teams helping them scope their work correctly and in the right direction, in line with the business demands.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Within ING, we have noticed that in time process knowledge, adherence to the process and process performance have been in a downward spiral.

We develop custom solutions for some of the worldâs largest companies, government institutions and smaller growing organizations. We pride ourselves on our ability to bridge people and technology and to bring the passion and dedication of an entrepreneur to every project. Our team is composed of talented employees and freelancers around North &amp; South America (and a smattering across the globe).</div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><strong>Who You Are</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We love working with each other because we have built a culture that suits us well. We work primarily with freelancers and coordinate their talents for large projects. To be on our team, you must be:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li><strong></strong><strong>HAPPY:</strong>&nbsp;Where there is a will, there is a way. Having a positive disposition allows us to achieve great things and to support each other.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>HELPFUL:</strong> Always looking for ways that you can help others.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>CURIOUS:</strong> It is essential that you have a passion for learning. Technology changes daily, and life has a way of constantly raising the bar.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Our clients expect us to get the right thing done on budget and on time. Communicating expectations and meeting them is the cornerstone of success.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>A FREELANCER:</strong> This means that if you live within the USA, you will also maintain your own personal client list and that Modern Tribe will only comprise a proportion of your total income. Regardless of where you live, you need to be already freelancing.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. Itâs a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionalityâ¦itâs a lot of ground to cover. But weâve got an established workflow down that helps make sure weâre setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Though every project is different, hereâs the gist of our QA flow:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ol><li><strong>Kickoff meeting.</strong> Just a kickoff â meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><strong>Preparing docs.</strong> Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><strong>Review approved comps. </strong>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, youâll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><strong>QA walkthrough.</strong> Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, youâll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Prepare QA checklist + test plan. </strong>After seeing each component of the site in action, youâll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what youâre planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><strong>Heavy duty testing. </strong>Youâll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer.

Our list of \"awesome functionality that real customers will pay us for if only we can get it implemented\" is growing faster than we can check things off, and we need to immediately grow our team with an experienced engineer that can hop into a high-functioning, experienced team and start learning and contributing quickly.</p><br /><p>When you start at Spreedly (think first 6-12 months), you'll be spending 90%+ of your time working right on the product team building functionality for customers. Building product at Spreedly is somewhat unique in that our main product is a payments API used by other developers. So \"designing a UI\" often means thinking through how you would want a given API to work if you were using it and \"adding a feature for a customer\" often means working through how to securely enable a developer to do something interesting with a credit card number.</p><br /><p>Oh, did we forget to mention that? We work with credit card data. Constantly. It's basically what we get paid to do, so that others don't have to. So thinking about security is a way of life at Spreedly, as is building sustainable processes to keep things safe, and our auditors happy.</p><br /><p>What we're looking for in a senior engineer is somebody who's not afraid to jump into a pretty complex technical problem and make sense of them. We regularly deal with the dark underbelly of software &ndash; think encryption, encoding, and security, all within the context of a distributed system. You don't have to be an expert in any of those aspects, but you shouldn't be intimidated by the thought of learning about them either.</p><br /><p>Once you've gotten your feet under you and understand the domain well enough, we envision you being the technical lead for one aspect of our service. That means you can work with junior engineers and help them tackle the task at hand using pragmatic software practices. We don't want rockstars or ninjas. We need people that are good at their job while also elevating the people around them.</p><br /><p>We are open to remote candidates, but with a few caveats. Currently our whole technical team is in the RDU area and works out of our office in downtown Durham, NC two days a week, and from wherever we fancy the other three days a week. So while we are already operating in a remote-friendly way, and definitely see ourselves expanding our remote presence in the future, you would be the first engineer operating in a distributed fashion and we realize this involves additional burden.</p><br /><p>So, if you're remote, we would want to see previous experience operating as part of, and leading, a remote team, and a willingness to help us flesh out the nuances of having a hybrid working arrangement. We also want you to be in the continental US/Canada (for travel convenience) and have exceptional written and speaking communication (in English).</p><br /><p>If that sounds like you, please apply!</p>","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/110608/senior-software-engineer-spreedly","source":"stackoverflow","tags":["developer","engineer"]},{"date":1467815027000,"title":"Sr. Software Engineer","company":"Teckst","content":"<p><strong>About Teckst</strong><br>Teckst is a platform for businesses to receive and send text messages with customers.
