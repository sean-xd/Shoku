It is our aim to make it as achievable for a small team of scientists to pursue an ambitious therapeutic R&amp;D initiative as it has become for a small team of programmers to develop and deploy a web-based software product.</p>\n\n<p>The Emerald Cloud Laboratory (ECL) is a web-based life sciences lab, enabling scientists to move out of the lab, and to instead conduct research remotely from a computer. It empowers scientists to specify experiments with the precision and reproducibility of code, and to abstract away the physical execution of those experiments to Emerald’s robotically-driven facility in South San Francisco. Through the ECL, the resulting experimental data is accessible in perpetuity, detailed metadata is linked and explorable, and investigators are equipped with a suite of computational tools to drive of the algorithmic components of data analysis, freeing them to focus on the insights that are uniquely derived by scientists.</p>\n\n<h2>What You’ll Do</h2>\n\n<p>The Application Software Engineer designs and develops the Integrated Science Environment (ISE). The ISE is a desktop application built with web technologies. It offers scientists a broad suite of tools for designing experiments on the ECL, tracking their progress, and analyzing their results, all within the collaborative context of working alongside other researchers. Projects include: the notebook interface to Emerald’s Symbolic Lab Language (SLL); team-based features for managing projects and end-to-end research workflows; point-and-click expression builders that onboard users into the capabilities of SLL; building out the platform for running the web application on the desktop. We’re a small team, which means it is essential for every team member to be ready to take ownership and lead projects. Feature design and development is critical in this role, so you will work closely alongside Emerald’s world-class Design team.</p>\n\n<p>As an early team member helping to build the Engineering team as well as the product, you will also be encouraged to contribute to the software engineering best practices we maintain in our own work, and which we bring to Emerald as a whole. We strive to be continually critical of our process, cutting cruft and homing in on performance multipliers (like continuous integration and agile development practices).  </p>\n\n<h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>\n\n<p>Our applications are modern web applications (Backbone.js / HTML5 / CSS3) running on the desktop (with NW.js) across Windows and Mac OS. Our backend services are written in Go, and deployed on AWS infrastructure in Docker containers. Our source code control is on Github, with integration with Travis-CI for continuous testing. SLL and the Experiment Framework are written in the Wolfram Language and Clojure. Our stack is always evolving, and we welcome new ideas and technologies which enhance our ability to deliver incredible software.</p>\n\n<p>The Application Engineering role operates primarily in frontend UX technologies like Backbone / Marionette and NW.js. More broadly, bringing online the first cloud-based biotech lab is an expansive, diverse challenge. A core component of our job is consistently determining the right tools for the job at hand, and diving in to learn these new technologies along the way.</p>\n\n<h2>Applying</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like to apply or learn more, we’d love to hear from you!

UX designer. Experience designer. Digital designer. Front-end designer. Ugh...maybe it&#39;s just easier if we explain who we&#39;re looking for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s who we’re looking for…</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You’re someone who knows modern interface design in your bones, and you’ve spent the last 3–5 years proving it. To us that means design systems and pattern libraries, marketing sites, dashboards, onboarding flows, icons, and maybe even illustration/graphics, branding/identity, and app design.</li>\n<li>You not only sweat the details, you sweat through your shirt. Seriously though, we tend to look at our product design from 10,000 feet.

We want someone to really own this (besides one of our co-founders, you’ll be the only other designer on the team for a while).</li>\n<li>Maybe you’re not exactly a Designer Who Can Code™, but you’re at least capable of turning your designs into live prototypes of some fidelity. But hey, if you can crank out production-ready code, even better.</li>\n<li>We have a tendency to fly by the seat of our pants when it comes to product design, so you’re either comfortable with that, or you’re someone who can whip our process into shape.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re a small company, so there are a lot of opportunities to design things...everything mentioned above plus packaging, signage, even our new office (coming early 2017).

Returns from each project will be divided fairly among the team, allowing us to continue our work, and working for ourselves.</p><br /><p>I came to Portland&nbsp;looking for two great minds. One with brilliant development skills. One with brilliant design skills. Both with a constant drive to learn, a passion for exchanging knowledge, and excitement for great ideas. I have 10 solid app ideas lined up, ready for collaboration. Yet, if we sit down together and decide on a different plan of action, so be it. We'll always have an agenda to fall back on.</p><br /><p>While the childhood of this think tank will be code-based and focused, we will generate ample revenue, experience, and momentum to pursue further, diverse venues. There are plenty of things that could be better addressed on this planet. We will continually make strong efforts to provide needed solutions and create opportunity world-wide.

When companies have to choose to accept remote workers versus going the traditional HR route (interview, in person, at the office), they fall back on their resources that they know are clear.

When you're a remote worker, your odds of getting hired for a remote position are dim, because you are competing against a huge pool of talent, e.g. all the other remotes. Additionally, you are only seeing a small amount of opportunities that are really possible.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>This is where ExpertsAvailableNow comes in.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>By having remote workers (digital nomads, vagabundos, telecommuters, call them what you will) post to us their expertise and show their available skills, new and immediate job openings are instantly available to them. It's a huge success. Companies hire quickly, on a whim, instead of going through a tedious hiring process, accepting applications, and so on. When companies have to choose to accept remote workers versus going the traditional HR route (interview, in person, at the office), they fall back on their resources that they know are clear. But, companies who can see the immediately available pool of talent to hire from, prefer the diversity of remote workers. Being in the right place at the right time is easier than ever with Experts Available Now</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And there's less risk for workers and employers.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Contracts are easier to arrange, and smaller projects are no problem because the number of inquiries an expert receives keep coming in.
