You aren&rsquo;t looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality match with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It&rsquo;s your shot at filtering out candidates that don&rsquo;t fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now.

Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.&nbsp;</strong>What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.<strong></strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Location</strong><br /></div><div>Work from anywhere in the&nbsp;<strong>US or Canada</strong>; if you are in&nbsp;<strong>Central or South America</strong>, letâs talk.

About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs.
