Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source for workloads and applications running on more than one instance. \n Delivering a reliable, scalable, and high-performance service requires engineers with exceptional technical expertise and fearless creativity.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.</p><br /><p>Firefly is a highly-regarded learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We&rsquo;ve grown organically but rapidly over the last decade, and are on track to continue doing so.</p><br /><p>As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we&rsquo;re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We're currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We&rsquo;re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).</p><br /><p>There are four main things we are looking for at Firefly:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.</li><br /><li>a desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.</li><br /><li>understanding: Our product team is great but not infallible. You&rsquo;ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users&rsquo; best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You&rsquo;ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.</li><br /><li>clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what&rsquo;s going on and what&rsquo;s planned, you&rsquo;ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what&rsquo;s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we&rsquo;re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.</p><br /><p>In terms of experience, we have one essential requirement:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are comfortable with iOS or a web platform.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you&rsquo;ll need to know these or be able to pick them up.&nbsp;We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting</li><br /><li>Knowledge and experience of infrastructure automation</li><br /><li>Detailed knowledge of databases, particularly SQL Server</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience. All of Firefly participate in a yearly bonus scheme based on the success of the business and their contribution. We&rsquo;re committed to everyone&rsquo;s professional development, so we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending training courses or other events. In development, we have a weekly lunch-and-learn to hear about new topics and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.</p><br /><p>So, if you&rsquo;ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We're small, which means we can stay close to our clients and develop and improve our products very quickly to meet their needs. It also means you'll get great exposure to all of the things that go on in a fast growing business, and have a chance to have a big impact very quickly. We're also quite a close-knit team, so we're keen to find somebody with good social skills who would enjoy and thrive in this environment.

Our derivatives teams meet these challenges by offering a one-stop solution that brings transparency, efficiency and excellence to market professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Fixed Income Pricing</p>\n\n<p>The Fixed Income (FI) Pricing group builds a product that is the market standard for pricing and provides up to date and accurate information to the global financial community.

Our application suite includes high precision pricing algorithms, accurate end-of-day price generation systems, liquidity hubs for storing and retrieving pricing information, sophisticated user interfaces and big data analytics platforms. These products are extensively used by various market players such as portfolio managers, risk officers, analysts and traders.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign Exchange</p>\n\n<p>The Foreign Exchange (FX) group provides market leading analytic functionality and award-winning currency pricing and data. Because FX trades are over the counter (bank to bank; not traded in exchanges), it is important for traders to have transparency into market prices.

Technical opportunities run the gamut from architecting systems to designing databases to UI development. Another aspect of this group is to track and manage the lifecycle of millions of futures and options securities across 100+ exchanges around the world. Our futures and options product makes discoverability of such securities easy, which proves to be a very important for our clients in a dynamic environment.</p>\n\n<p>Economics</p>\n\n<p>The Economics group puts the fundamentals of our economy in front of hundreds of thousands of clients every day. We develop the tools that manage real-time releases of economic statistics coming from governments around the world.

This functionality is among the most used across the Bloomberg terminal and is invaluable to clients. The product allows for clear understanding of vast global data sets spanning 30+ years, big data analytics, real-time alerting and complex financial data. We build applications for discovering and analyzing market trends, aggregating and evaluating analyst predictions, and screening and back-testing investment ideas. The group is made up of fast-paced teams passionate about time-to-market, performance and visual design.</p>\n\n<p>Fixed Income Core</p>\n\n<p>The Fixed Income Core group develops software to support analytics and data that move global fixed income markets. We cover government, corporate, money market, municipal and preferred instruments. Our clients depend on our pricing algorithms, high performance calculation libraries, trading applications and real-time big data analysis to make informed decisions.

You discover Marco is working on a story which is becoming more and more complex, so you help him keeping things simple and at the same time aligned better with the business case. After the stand up you sit beside Rafael who is having troubles working on a Google Analytics API client. You try to understand what is exactly the problem and with your help, Rafael come up with a new approach on how to solve the problem.</p><br /><p>You meet a candidate over lunch. You aren&rsquo;t looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality match with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It&rsquo;s your shot at filtering out candidates that don&rsquo;t fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now. Of course, your senior team members will pick her apart technically later.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon, you have a face to face sync with Rafael. You ask if the new approach for the API client is working. Then you talk about what he will be focusing on the upcoming months. He has no clear idea about that and so you ask him questions about which epic motivates him the most and which task he prefers. Rafael has a clearer idea now about his focus and he will think how to keep attention in this.&nbsp;<br>Since you have no more meetings in the day, you propose a table tennis tournament with the whole team.

The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss.

We believe in using the best tool for the job while maintaining a slight bias toward the tools the team knows the best.

We never need to check our code coverage to know that it's at 100%: with disciplined TDD, no line of code will be written without a test. We're confident that our automated testing is thorough and will catch any regression bugs - and that&rsquo;s critical given the software we write! We use continuous integration to test every version of every client library against our gateway.</p><br /><p>We are agile...</p><br /><p>Agile development methodologies mean different things to different people. For us, the most important part of Agile is doing what works best for the team. We have a story card wall and release a few times a week. We keep the team in sync with daily stand-ups and have a retrospective once a month to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements. We&rsquo;re pragmatic, not dogmatic. Although we have strong opinions, we're never afraid to try to new things to see if they work and reconsider our positions if the situation warrants it.&nbsp;<br><br>We value our people...&nbsp;<br><br>-Two paid conferences annually to everyone on the Products Team</p><br /><p>-<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1xpl0mO\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Dev Day</a>&nbsp;twice a month&nbsp;</p><br /><p>-Catered lunches daily</p><br /><p>-Commuter reimbursement program</p><br /><p>Take a look at some of our blog posts and scope our code on GitHub</p><br /><p><a href=\"https://www.braintreepayments.com/blogs/braintrust\" rel=\"nofollow\">Braintrust<br><br></a><a href=\"https://github.com/braintree\" rel=\"nofollow\">Braintree GitHub</a></p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/52266/senior-software-engineer-braintree","source":"stackoverflow","tags":["engineer","python","node",".net","java"]},{"date":1468354777000,"title":"Software Engineer - Commerce","company":"Braintree","content":"<p><strong><em>About Us:</em></strong></p><br /><p>Every time you pay for an Uber ride or book on Airbnb, you&rsquo;re using our product.

Superdry focuses on offering our customers around the world innovative, premium quality and affordable clothing and accessories across menswear, womenswear and specialist ranges. Superdry customers are loyal, varied and truly global, and are defined not by their age but by their attitude.</p><br /><p>Superdry was launched in the UK in 2003 following an inspirational trip by our founders to Tokyo, and is famous for designing and producing quality garments inspired by fusing iconic vintage Americana and high-impact Japanese graphic imagery with a British twist. Our products are characterised by quality fabrics with authentic vintage washes, unique detailing, world-leading hand-drawn graphics, and tailored fits with diverse styling. As we continue to develop the breadth and nature of our product ranges, we increasingly appeal to a broader group of customers, aspirational people who want to feel amazing in what they wear and appreciate style, quality and attention to detail.</p><br /><p>We operate a fast-growing multi-channel business through a combination of standalone stores, franchised and licensed stores, concessions, ecommerce, wholesale and distributors. We are growing fastest outside of the UK and our international business is going from strength to strength. We now own and operate stores in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the USA, with franchised stores in many more countries. We have nearly 600 points of sale in over 45 different countries and are adding to this at a rate of over 50 new locations annually. We have also entered a joint venture with Trendy International Group in China which will launch Superdry stores into the Chinese market.</p><br /><p>Our global headquarters are based in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, UK and we have satellite offices in Aarhus, Barcelona, Brussels, Hong Kong, Munich and New York, with specialist sourcing offices in Istanbul and New Delhi. Our biggest growth area is online, where we operate ecommerce websites in over 20 different languages and ship to almost every country in the world.</p><br /><p>Our ambition for growth is summarised by our strategic plan which will provide opportunities to drive significant increases in revenue. Our plan focuses on three key areas - building a global lifestyle brand; driving awareness of the breadth of the Superdry range; and building a broad cross-channel relationship with customers. It&rsquo;s supported by the four key pillars of Embed, Enable, Extend and Execute, which define exactly how we will go about achieving our aims. As our product is at the very heart of what Superdry is all about, we are also focusing hard on our four key product attributes - design detail; quality obsession; innovation; and affordability. More about the detail of our strategic plan, together with our latest business and financial results, can be found on our corporate website www.supergroup.co.uk.</p><br /><p>We aspire to be a great place to work and strive every day to make every Superdry store and office location a friendly community with a family feel, with fantastic training and development, and roles that are compelling, stretching and interesting.

Our ecommerce business has experienced incredible growth in recent years and is now one of our most profitable and successful sales channels.

It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.

If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><a href=\"http://tri.be/\"><strong>Modern Tribe, Inc.</strong></a> is a rapidly growing software &amp; design company. We develop custom solutions for some of the worldâs largest companies, government institutions and smaller growing organizations. We pride ourselves on our ability to bridge people and technology and to bring the passion and dedication of an entrepreneur to every project. Our team is composed of talented employees and freelancers around North &amp; South America (and a smattering across the globe).</div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><strong>Who You Are</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We love working with each other because we have built a culture that suits us well. We work primarily with freelancers and coordinate their talents for large projects. To be on our team, you must be:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li><strong></strong><strong>HAPPY:</strong>&nbsp;Where there is a will, there is a way. Having a positive disposition allows us to achieve great things and to support each other.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>HELPFUL:</strong> Always looking for ways that you can help others.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>CURIOUS:</strong> It is essential that you have a passion for learning. Technology changes daily, and life has a way of constantly raising the bar.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Our clients expect us to get the right thing done on budget and on time. Communicating expectations and meeting them is the cornerstone of success.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>A FREELANCER:</strong> This means that if you live within the USA, you will also maintain your own personal client list and that Modern Tribe will only comprise a proportion of your total income. Regardless of where you live, you need to be already freelancing.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. Itâs a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionalityâ¦itâs a lot of ground to cover. But weâve got an established workflow down that helps make sure weâre setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Though every project is different, hereâs the gist of our QA flow:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ol><li><strong>Kickoff meeting.</strong> Just a kickoff â meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><strong>Preparing docs.</strong> Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><strong>Review approved comps. </strong>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, youâll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><strong>QA walkthrough.</strong> Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, youâll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Prepare QA checklist + test plan. </strong>After seeing each component of the site in action, youâll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what youâre planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><strong>Heavy duty testing. </strong>Youâll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isnât everything â QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end userâs shoes.</li><li>A strong familiarity with WordPress; youâll be expected to prove your competence with the platform.</li><li>Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills</li><li>1+ year remote freelancing experience</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Additional Skills (Bonus Points)</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally</li><li>Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects</li><li>Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Full-time freelancers </strong>are the only candidates weâre looking for at this time; we are not seeking F/T or P/T employees, nor can we work with somebody moonlighting from a full-time gig.
