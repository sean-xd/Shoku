Salary will be based on experience.</p><h2>About you</h2><p>You will be joining a team of passionate programmers, each with their own ideas about technology but all with the same love of development.</p><h3>Test driven</h3><p>Not to be mistaken with test driven development, although we will come to that later. You’ll need a test driven attitude to all the work you undertake at Lighthouse, this is a sentiment that is mirrored throughout the company.</p><h3>Passionate and proud</h3><p>You refer to lines of your code as cool and tell anyone that will listen about your latest design pattern triumph.</p><h3>Open-minded</h3><p>With countless new languages/frameworks/patterns appearing every month, some branded better than others, it’s easy to get caught up in the hype. You’ll have an open mind and be able to choose the right technology to fit the situation.</p><h2>About your skills</h2><p>All the developers at Lighthouse have an eclectic mix of technical skills that determine what projects they undertake and who to pester for advice. This leaves the field open for you to find your place in the team and own it.</p><p>On the backend we work in PHP and MySQL using frameworks like CakePHP 3, Laravel and every now and then throwing something together ourselves. On the frontend we have knowledge of a range of the 100s of JavaScript frameworks/libraries including Backbone, JQuery and Angular.</p><p>Nothing is set in stone with regards to the technology we use, the main thing is that every choice is justified and supported.</p><h3>Test driven development</h3><p>It’s the big buzz words at the moment but it’s worth it. You will understand the time and place for testing and the benefits it brings. Even if you don’t have knowledge of it in practice you will be open to giving it a try and we will be there to support you.</p><h3>Planning</h3><p>You will be required to gather requirements work with clients throughout scoping and estimate projects. Not running in head first is usually a good idea.</p><h3>Collaboration</h3><p>Branch, add, commit, push and merge! You will have knowledge of git and accompanying patterns that allow you to quickly become part of the team and get that first commit in.</p><h2>Improve with us</h2><p>We’re always trying to learn new skills and regularly refresh our workflow to include new ideas and deliverables.</p><p>We’re ambitious but the environment is relaxed and sociable. The only thing we demand is that you never stop learning and trying to make the next project better than the last.

We’re not huge but have a big mix of skills allowing us to take projects from concept through to design and development pushing out excellent work and constantly striving to better ourselves.</p><p>Starting out as a web design and development studio we’ve changed a little over the years. While we still work with clients to create awesome websites a large part of our business is now spent working with startups to build bespoke digital products creating new online businesses and <a href=\"http://wearelighthouse.com/blog/how-prototyping-helped-headliner-develop-the-right-features-for-their-customers/\">helping entrepreneurs take their ideas to market</a>.</p><h3>The boring small print</h3><p>You must be a UK resident and available to work in our London office on a full-time basis.

Most of our customers are local governments, non-profit organizations and academic or federal research projects. We build custom apps; perform geospatial analysis; manage several open source civic software projects (DistrictBuilder ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/\">http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/</a> ), OpenTreeMap ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/\">http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/</a> ) and others ( <a href=\"http://github.com/azavea/\">http://github.com/azavea/</a> )); and develop an open source, high performance computing framework, GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io\">https://geotrellis.io</a> ), that enables us to build fast analytical applications by distributing the geospatial data processing. Our developers work across the technology stack from database and application servers in the infrastructure layer to modern, browser-based front-ends.</p>\n\n<p>The Geospatial Insights Team</p>\n\n<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data. The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product teams or professional services teams. The Geospatial Insights team works on a couple of custom software projects, but its current primary focus is on developing three leading edge SaaS products: HunchLab ( <a href=\"http://www.hunchlab.com/\">http://www.hunchlab.com/</a> ), a web application for forecasting of geographic crime risk; Raster Foundry, a toolkit for processing aerial and satellite imagery at scale; and ModelLab, a spatial data processing framework. HunchLab is sold as a SaaS product to law enforcement agencies and applies a mix of clever software, statistics, machine learning and AWS clusters to create a powerful analysis tool that is being used to improve public safety in communities around the world. The other two products are just beginning development and are funded by research grants from the US Department of Energy and NASA, respectively. The Geospatial Insights team is particularly strong with Javascript, Python, R, Scala, Spark, PostgreSQL, and architecting solutions for the AWS platform.</p>\n\n<p>With the new research grants, we are looking to grow the team, and we need your help to scale up our development capacity.</p>\n\n<p>What You’ll Do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement application code, APIs and web or mobile clients based on wireframes and designs developed by our UI/UX Design team. </li>\n<li>Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to database design, architecture, development, testing and deployment. </li>\n<li>Optimize database, server and client performance to create applications with both functional and responsive user experiences. </li>\n<li>Build, provision, and deploy servers in a repeatable way to AWS. </li>\n<li>Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to build and support scalable web applications in Python/Django, or another MVC framework (C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, Java/JVM/Spring, Scala/Play). We do a lot of work in Python/Django, Javascript, and Scala and dabble in others depending on client and project requirements. </li>\n<li>Demonstrate fluency in core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and contemporary Javascript libraries like jQuery, React, or AngularJS. </li>\n<li>Express solid understanding of MVC architecture, RESTful design patterns, and the DRY principle. </li>\n<li>Be comfortable managing VMs and working in a Linux environment. </li>\n<li>Be interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects. </li>\n<li>Get excited about a diversity of both projects and technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get extra points for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background in math and statistics or experience with R. </li>\n<li>Experience with open source or commercial geospatial toolkits like OpenLayers, Leaflet, GeoServer, PostGIS, CartoDB, ArcGIS, and GoogleMaps. </li>\n<li>Experience with mobile apps (Objective C, Android or responsive HTML). </li>\n<li>Experience scaling apps within AWS. </li>\n<li>Experience provisioning servers with Ansible. </li>\n<li>Knowledge of distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc. </li>\n<li>Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we don’t say “X-Y years of experience” or “M.S. in Computer Science.” Formal credentials like these are not irrelevant, but we are primarily looking for people who have had experience successfully building sophisticated web applications. You might have had these kinds of experiences without a college degree. Or you may be just out of school but worked your way through school and had some great co-op experiences. Or you might have a math or humanities background but a have a great head for software development. These are all potentially great backgrounds, and we’d be interested in hearing from you.</p>\n\n<p>Office and Benefits</p>\n\n<p>Our Philadelphia office is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, a shower and lockers. It’s an open office plan with several smaller rooms for team meetings, private space and concentration time. You get a top-end Linux workstation, Mac or Windows laptop with a pile of memory for VMs and extra monitors. We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule. After the first six months, our developers can also spend up to 10% of their time on a geospatial open source, professional development, or R&amp;D project. For example, some of our colleagues are contributors to the PostGIS ( <a href=\"http://postgis.refractions.net/\">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a> ), OpenLayers ( <a href=\"http://openlayers.org/\">http://openlayers.org/</a> ), GDAL ( <a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/\">http://www.gdal.org/</a> ) and GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io/\">https://geotrellis.io/</a> ) projects. Other research projects have included improving dev ops tool chains; using FFT ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform</a> ) for fast kernel density estimation ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density</a> ); working with Spark to develop machine learning tools; and using GPUs for faster raster data processing. Once a quarter, we all get together to share our research and learning with our colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/\">http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/</a> ) that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children </li>\n<li>Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance </li>\n<li>Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not </li>\n<li>Retirement plan with matching percentage </li>\n<li>Almost 4 weeks paid vacation plus additional paid sick/personal time off </li>\n<li>Family and medical leave </li>\n<li>Flexible work schedule </li>\n<li>Paid maternity and paternity leave </li>\n<li>Child care subsidy </li>\n<li>Paid time off for voting and volunteering </li>\n<li>Education assistance plan </li>\n<li>Student loan assistance </li>\n<li>Public transit and biking reimbursement plans </li>\n<li>Monthly guest lectures with lunches on the house </li>\n<li>10% time for Research or Training Projects </li>\n<li>Profit-sharing bonus plan </li>\n<li>Financial transparency through an open book policy </li>\n<li>Kind, capable and thoughtful colleagues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We welcome qualified candidates from all walks of life and value diversity in our company, and we prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status, military service, disability unrelated to job requirements, marital status, or domestic partner status.</p>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/f95be01e-871e-11e6-8958-59c1698d958d","source":"github","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","aws","rails","python","android","react","angular",".net","java"]}],"latest":1475247815000},{"name":"Arrowsight","jobs":[{"date":1475246482000,"title":"SQL Server Engineer","company":"Arrowsight","content":"<p>Are you passionate about SQL Server programming, data modeling, and database reliability? &nbsp;Come join us!</p><br /><p>You'll be developing and revamping databases&nbsp;and back-end scripts that enable us to analyze thousands of video segments every day.

The team benefits from a pluridisciplinary research environment, where quantitative analysis plays a strong role in linking a wide spectrum of models, reaching from detailed process based biophysical models to global economic models. The Program is strongly connected to the international academic community, placing emphasis on transdisciplinary synergies and applied approaches. The work accomplished has long been recognized through regular publication in high-ranking scientific journals. In addition, the ESM Program has been invited to participate in numerous policy-oriented consultations and large scale scientific exercises.</p><br /><p>Accurate and reliable spatially explicit information on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and in particular its anthropogenic use, is at the crux of our need to understand our changing planet and to be able to create biophysical and economic models with reliable input and calibration data. However, it is exactly this information that has been shown to be highly inaccurate over many areas of the globe and across multiple sectors. Hence the <a href=\"http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/EOS.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth Observation Systems (EOS) Research Group</a> has built and deployed tools and platforms to use citizen science, crowdsourcing and expert knowledge in order to improve in-situ data and the overall information base of land cover and land use globally via product integration and geospatial approaches.</p><br /><p>The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform and community to generate, share and utilize information on land, soil and water resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a longstanding challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge.</p>","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/124988/mobile-app-developer-serious-gaming-international-institute-for","source":"stackoverflow","location":"IIASA","tags":["developer"]}],"latest":1473950337000},{"name":"Index Exchange","jobs":[{"date":1473949215000,"title":"Integrations Engineer","company":"Index Exchange","content":"<p>Operating within our nascent Professional Services team, we&rsquo;re looking for an Associate Technical Consultant/Integrations Engineer who will manage and execute the entire integrations life-cycle including planning, discovery, design, configuration, testing and deployment in addition to project and client management responsibilities.

We&#39;re hiring a designer. This is a full-time, salaried position on the mighty Cotton Bureau squad. We&#39;re not actually sure what to call this position specifically, because, well, our industry isn&#39;t quite sure what to call it either. Web designer. Interface designer. UI designer. UX designer. Experience designer. Digital designer. Front-end designer. Ugh...maybe it&#39;s just easier if we explain who we&#39;re looking for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s who we’re looking for…</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You’re someone who knows modern interface design in your bones, and you’ve spent the last 3–5 years proving it. To us that means design systems and pattern libraries, marketing sites, dashboards, onboarding flows, icons, and maybe even illustration/graphics, branding/identity, and app design.</li>\n<li>You not only sweat the details, you sweat through your shirt. Seriously though, we tend to look at our product design from 10,000 feet. We need someone who comes equipped with a jeweler’s loupe.</li>\n<li>Chances are, you’ve been on a larger design team at a startup/service/company/agency recently, but wherever you’ve been, you’re ready to make a bigger difference at a smaller company. We want someone to really own this (besides one of our co-founders, you’ll be the only other designer on the team for a while).</li>\n<li>Maybe you’re not exactly a Designer Who Can Code™, but you’re at least capable of turning your designs into live prototypes of some fidelity. But hey, if you can crank out production-ready code, even better.</li>\n<li>We have a tendency to fly by the seat of our pants when it comes to product design, so you’re either comfortable with that, or you’re someone who can whip our process into shape.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re a small company, so there are a lot of opportunities to design things...everything mentioned above plus packaging, signage, even our new office (coming early 2017).

That sounds trite, but it’s why we stand out. <a href=\"https://atlarge.cottonbureau.com/\">You can read more about our story and principles here</a>.</li>\n<li>We’re a three-year-old profitable company with a real business model.

Steeds meer taken worden gedecentraliseerd, terwijl tegelijkertijd de middelen afnemen. Publieke spelers en marktpartijen raken steeds meer verweven en de overheid vraagt meer eigen verantwoordelijkheid en zelfredzaamheid van de burger. De overheid zal dienstverlening regisseren in plaats van die helemaal zelf te leveren, en zal maatschappelijke initiatieven vanuit de burger en de markt steeds meer faciliteren.<br>PinkRoccade Local Government biedt overheidsorganisaties een integraal platform voor gegevenslogistiek &amp; informatievoorziening met de naam Makelaarsuite. Makelaarsuite biedt gemeenten alle benodigde functionaliteit om gegevens over burgers en bedrijven uit te wisselen tussen de gemeentelijke afdelingen en met externe organisaties zoals waterschappen, belastingkantoren en Jeugdzorg. De toegevoegde waarde van Makelaarsuite is dat gemeenten altijd in staat zijn gebruik te maken van de juiste en actuele gegevens, waardoor de kwaliteit van de dienstverlening naar burgers en bedrijven toeneemt. Makelaarsuite biedt daarnaast functionaliteit om gegevens om te zetten in informatie. Dit gebeurt met behulp van business intelligence achtige analyses, linked data toepassingen en in de toekomst ook big data. Met de informatie die gemeenten via Makelaarsuite beschikbaar hebben kunnen zij processen als handhaving verbeteren of bijvoorbeeld beleid maken dat beter aansluit bij de wensen van de burgers in de gemeente.

You will work directly with the team to help automate, provision, and scale the services that support our customers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>For example, we are currently expanding to new data centers.
