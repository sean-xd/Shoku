{"jobs":[{"name":"Mule Design","jobs":[{"date":1474393602000,"title":"Design Technologist","company":"Mule Design","content":"<p><p>Mule is hiring a Design Technologist. We use that term to mean, “someone who is passionate about making great design real using web technology.” This is our primary technical role, but there’s a lot more to it than writing code. Mule is small. Everybody contributes to the overall strategy of our projects and our team.</p><p>This is the part in most technical job postings where there’d be a list of software and tech that you should be proficient in, but I want to write that list as little as you want to read it. Being a successful Mule has less to do with the tools you use, and more to do with what you do with them.</p><p>Here’s what a Design Technologist does at Mule:</p><ol><li>Prototyping. We make prototypes to validate or demonstrate design. Sometimes these are low-fidelity, for getting an idea across quickly. Other times they’re high-fidelity, and act as a final step before implementation.</li><li>Researching technology. Every client we take on comes to us with a unique set of problems and constraints. We need a combination of existing knowledge and insatiable curiosity to identify the particular solution for them—and convince them that it’s the right one.</li><li>Communicating. We are a client services studio. We are in daily contact with our clients, whether over the phone, face-to-face, or in writing. Everybody at Mule is a skilled communicator.</li><li>Evaluating design through a technical lens. Good interactive design works in harmony with technology. A good design technologist can see through an interface to its underlying logic, and correct it or clarify it as they see fit.</li><li>Making and sharing tools. We do not give designers fish. We give them fishing line. The technology team is constantly working on ways to bring designers closer to high-fidelity, client-ready code. We listen, teach, and facilitate as much as we build.</li><li>Learning. As a work culture, Mule is not about the New Hotness™. But it’s foolish to ignore the great work being done in the design and tech world around us. Part of our job is separating the wheat from the chaff to keep our work swift and modern.</li></ol><p>We care less about experience than passion and grit. The right person for this job loves to learn and to teach. They have strongly-held opinions, but can change them in the face of superior reasoning. They don’t mind having an (amiable) argument to make the team’s work better. If this sounds like you, then read on.</p>How to apply<p>Tell us briefly why you are the right person for the job. Don’t attach anything. People make it through our job application process without us ever seeing a résumé. Save yourself time and don’t write one.</p></p>","url":"https://authenticjobs.com/jobs/27994/design-technologist","source":"authenticjobs","location":"San Francisco, CA, US","tags":["designer","ios"]}],"latest":1474393602000},{"name":"Lapis Software Associates","jobs":[{"date":1474389393000,"title":"Java Web Application Software Developer","company":"Lapis Software Associates","content":"<p><h3>About Us:</h3><p>Lapis is one of the leading software and consulting organizations for Gaming Technology, particularly On-Line Lottery systems.

We improve the stability and performance of the databases for customers (as well as adding features and working through initialization and self-healing logic).

Hopefully you have some experience deep within the technical guts of the database, perhaps with Elasticsearch index usage or MySQL replication practices.</li>\n<li>linux process management and resource utilization. A solid set of experiences with back-end engineering, in particular using things like linux system tuning, network performance monitoring, or database i/o usage to improve customer experience with their database.</li>\n<li>tradeoffs in high availability systems used by databases &#8211; are you comfortable explaining CAP theorem tradeoffs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Character traits…</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>self-managing and self-prioritizing with good team communication practices</li>\n<li>empathy for customers and team members, yet an ability to say “no” when it is best for the product</li>\n<li>inventive: database team members are kind of like the engineer on old ships — you may not have a solution and all the answers, but give you time and you can come up with one.</li>\n<li>looking toward improvement: we all fail; it’s how we clean up our messes after the fail that makes a good product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Think you&#8217;re a match?</strong></p>\n<p>Compose implements blind-hiring!

At your question &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think this method is too big?&rdquo;, Erik decides to refactor the code a little bit and together with you he creates a more SOLID solution.<br><br>It&rsquo;s already lunch time, and since there is a beautiful sun outside, you decide to have a sandwich with Erik in &nbsp;the Central Station square just in front of the office. During lunch, Erik shows his interest on TDD, a practise he knows but he has small experience with. So you decide to work with him at the next story in the sprint with a pair programming session. He is pretty enthusiast and you are amazed how he could work in a TDD way with very few hints from your side. The first task of the story is done and Erik and you ask Kevin to review the related Pull Request. Kevin thinks your test class is too messy, so he joins you and Erik behind the same computer. You recognise you should have mocked up your dependencies better and Erik starts doing that with Kevin&rsquo;s support.<br><br><strong>Team</strong><br>You will be working in a team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization (backend and frontend developers, UX designers).

The team benefits from a pluridisciplinary research environment, where quantitative analysis plays a strong role in linking a wide spectrum of models, reaching from detailed process based biophysical models to global economic models. The Program is strongly connected to the international academic community, placing emphasis on transdisciplinary synergies and applied approaches. The work accomplished has long been recognized through regular publication in high-ranking scientific journals. In addition, the ESM Program has been invited to participate in numerous policy-oriented consultations and large scale scientific exercises.</p><br /><p>Accurate and reliable spatially explicit information on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and in particular its anthropogenic use, is at the crux of our need to understand our changing planet and to be able to create biophysical and economic models with reliable input and calibration data. However, it is exactly this information that has been shown to be highly inaccurate over many areas of the globe and across multiple sectors. Hence the <a href=\"http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/EOS.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth Observation Systems (EOS) Research Group</a> has built and deployed tools and platforms to use citizen science, crowdsourcing and expert knowledge in order to improve in-situ data and the overall information base of land cover and land use globally via product integration and geospatial approaches.</p><br /><p>The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform and community to generate, share and utilize information on land, soil and water resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a longstanding challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/124988/mobile-app-developer-international-institute-for","source":"stackoverflow","location":"IIASA","tags":["developer"]}],"latest":1473950337000},{"name":"Ypsomed AG","jobs":[{"date":1473949343000,"title":"Manager Digital Innovation","company":"Ypsomed AG","content":"<p>To build the new <strong>Digital Innovation</strong> Group in the Technology area of the Innovation department at the <strong>Burgdorf</strong> site, we are seeking a <strong>strategic</strong> and <strong>creative thinker</strong> with a passion for all digital things for the role of<br><br> <strong>Manager Digital Innovation<br><br>Your key responsibilities <br></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>To define and develop the digital strategy for the business fields of Ypsomed Delivery Systems and mylife Diabetescare in cooperation with Marketing &amp; Sales</li><br /><li>To build and manage the new Digital Innovation Group</li><br /><li>To develop concepts for new digital products, services and business models</li><br /><li>To drive forward the digital transformation within the company</li><br /><li>To engage with in-house and external contacts on all aspects of digital technology</li><br /><li>To ensure a good working relationship with external partners in the digital systems field</li><br /><li>To pursue technological development</li><br /><li>To attend trade fairs and presentations</li><br /></ul>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/125006/manager-digital-innovation-ypsomed-ag","source":"stackoverflow","location":"Burgdorf, Schweiz","tags":["manager"]}],"latest":1473949343000},{"name":"Priva","jobs":[{"date":1473948331000,"title":"Embedded Software Engineer","company":"Priva","content":"<p><strong>Embedded Software Engineer&nbsp;</strong><br><em>voor 32 tot 40 uur per week</em><br><em>locatie: De Lier&nbsp;(bij Delft)</em><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Waarom bij Priva&nbsp;werken als Embedded Software Ontwikkelaar?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Ontwikkelen van (platform)software voor embedded devices in een hightech omgeving.</li><br /><li>Werken in een breed spectrum, van IO tot front-end applicatie.</li><br /><li>Inspelen op trends als Internet of Things, Big Data en de Cloud.</li><br /><li>Software ontwikkeling in eigen beheer in een multidisciplinaire omgeving.</li><br /><li>Werken in zelfsturende Scrum / Agile teams.</li><br /><li>Werken bij een innovatief familiebedrijf.</li><br /><li>Werken aan producten die bijdragen aan een duurzame wereld.</li><br /><li>Aandacht voor groei en persoonlijke ontwikkeling.</li><br /><li>Een goede werksfeer met leuke collega&acute;s.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Op de Campus van Priva (<strong><a href=\"https://ltpx.nl/CXKJeeB\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.priva.nl</a></strong>) in het Westland werken ruim 300 medewerkers aan innovatieve producten en diensten voor de tuinbouw- en gebouwautomatisering.

Feature design and development is critical in this role, so you will work closely alongside Emerald’s world-class Design team.</p>\n\n<p>As an early team member helping to build the Engineering team as well as the product, you will also be encouraged to contribute to the software engineering best practices we maintain in our own work, and which we bring to Emerald as a whole. We strive to be continually critical of our process, cutting cruft and homing in on performance multipliers (like continuous integration and agile development practices).  </p>\n\n<h2>Our Tech Stack</h2>\n\n<p>Our applications are modern web applications (Backbone.js / HTML5 / CSS3) running on the desktop (with NW.js) across Windows and Mac OS. Our backend services are written in Go, and deployed on AWS infrastructure in Docker containers. Our source code control is on Github, with integration with Travis-CI for continuous testing. SLL and the Experiment Framework are written in the Wolfram Language and Clojure. Our stack is always evolving, and we welcome new ideas and technologies which enhance our ability to deliver incredible software.</p>\n\n<p>The Application Engineering role operates primarily in frontend UX technologies like Backbone / Marionette and NW.js. More broadly, bringing online the first cloud-based biotech lab is an expansive, diverse challenge. A core component of our job is consistently determining the right tools for the job at hand, and diving in to learn these new technologies along the way.</p>\n\n<h2>Applying</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like to apply or learn more, we’d love to hear from you! Please follow the link on this page, and include your resume and a remark or two about where you are coming from and why you are interested in Emerald and this role. We will contact you if we think there could be a match. </p>\n\n<p>Optional but welcome: \nA link to your Github account or any projects you are proud of can be especially helpful. With project links, please include some explanation to help us get our bearings.</p>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/fdad1a1c-7b29-11e6-9c94-d109e131f49a","source":"github","tags":["engineer","aws"]}],"latest":1473933908000},{"name":"Telefonica Digital","jobs":[{"date":1473933898000,"title":"Arue you a Software Developer?

Steeds meer taken worden gedecentraliseerd, terwijl tegelijkertijd de middelen afnemen. Publieke spelers en marktpartijen raken steeds meer verweven en de overheid vraagt meer eigen verantwoordelijkheid en zelfredzaamheid van de burger. De overheid zal dienstverlening regisseren in plaats van die helemaal zelf te leveren, en zal maatschappelijke initiatieven vanuit de burger en de markt steeds meer faciliteren.<br>PinkRoccade Local Government biedt overheidsorganisaties een integraal platform voor gegevenslogistiek &amp; informatievoorziening met de naam Makelaarsuite. Makelaarsuite biedt gemeenten alle benodigde functionaliteit om gegevens over burgers en bedrijven uit te wisselen tussen de gemeentelijke afdelingen en met externe organisaties zoals waterschappen, belastingkantoren en Jeugdzorg. De toegevoegde waarde van Makelaarsuite is dat gemeenten altijd in staat zijn gebruik te maken van de juiste en actuele gegevens, waardoor de kwaliteit van de dienstverlening naar burgers en bedrijven toeneemt. Makelaarsuite biedt daarnaast functionaliteit om gegevens om te zetten in informatie. Dit gebeurt met behulp van business intelligence achtige analyses, linked data toepassingen en in de toekomst ook big data. Met de informatie die gemeenten via Makelaarsuite beschikbaar hebben kunnen zij processen als handhaving verbeteren of bijvoorbeeld beleid maken dat beter aansluit bij de wensen van de burgers in de gemeente.

assessment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CANDIDATE SPECIFICATION:  KEY SELECTION CRITERIA</p>\n<p>Ideal Experience</p>\n<ul>\n<li>College graduate</li>\n<li>At least five years of business or executive search experience</li>\n<li>Domain expertise in an industry or functional space</li>\n<li>Experience working in a consulting environment and/or a role where multiple projects and competing demands are the norm</li>\n<li>Fluent in English and Polish (written &amp; spoken)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critical Competencies for Success</p>\n<p>The Spencer Stuart Associate will have the following attributes: </p>\n<p><em>Project Management:</em>  Plans, manages and drives own efforts to identify and develop a slate of quality candidates as measured by Consultant, client and candidate feedback.  The successful candidate will do this while handling multiple projects with competing deadlines, working with individuals who have differing styles, and managing challenging expectations by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking ownership of the project by doing what is needed at all phases of the search process, anticipating next steps and not waiting to be told what to do.</li>\n<li>Constantly reassessing priorities in own workload to realign resources where/when needed and proactively offering to do the same for the wider assignment team.</li>\n<li>Being prepared, where necessary, to work longer hours and to be available out of working hours, committing to deadlines and communicating progress against them to the assignment team and/or client.  Delivering on commitments on-time or notifying as early as possible if deadlines will slip.</li>\n<li>Leveraging the power of effective assessment and validation to surface quickly and efficiently outstanding, qualified candidates.</li>\n<li>Adapting personal approach when working with clients and colleagues of varying styles by probing to uncover what is important to each and adjusting communications and approach accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Judgment and Assessment:</em>  Ensures an efficient search process and quality outcome as measured by the time to complete an assignment and client satisfaction scores by maintaining expert knowledge of a candidate pool and an associated industry or functional area.  The successful candidate will do so in an environment where clients increasingly want to meet candidates quickly, the pool of interested candidates may be limited, or the role to be filled may not be viewed as attractive in the marketplace by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using knowledge of the market, a network of contacts, research tools and own experience to help develop the search strategy, provide an informed perspective, and help write a position specification that reflects the unique client requirements.</li>\n<li>Proactively targeting and contacting the most important business leaders of today and tomorrow, by making industry and third-party source calls to build candidate pool knowledge and to collect qualitative and quantitative information, and building credibility by demonstrating own knowledge of the industry and/or function.</li>\n<li>Using own knowledge and experience to frame the right questions to elicit information from the prospect/candidate about their experience, competencies, compensation details and other relevant data, and then make sound recommendations to the consultant on the person’s relevance for the role.</li>\n<li>Maintaining awareness of current business trends, staying abreast of economic news, reading the Wall Street Journal/FT (or other relevant press for the region) and industry-specific publications and remaining intellectually curious by asking questions and continually studying the business world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Interpersonal Skills:</em>  Enhance the efficiency of assignment execution and the quality of outcomes, as measured by the client’s comments and internal metrics, in a fast-paced environment where you compete for Consultant and client attention and “mind share” and work with multiple stakeholders of varying styles by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being authentic.</li>\n<li>Listening and asking questions to clarify understanding and demonstrate knowledge.</li>\n<li>Adapting own style to suit the communication needs of the other person.</li>\n<li>Setting expectations and clarifying roles to avoid duplication of effort and wasting precious time and resources.</li>\n<li>Raising issues early and finding solutions collaboratively to avoid problems.</li>\n<li>Remaining poised when under pressure or handling unexpected challenges.</li>\n<li>Distilling information from a variety of sources, develop an informed perspective and share that with others.</li>\n<li>Conveying information in a compelling way, beyond “just the facts” that resonates with the needs and audience.</li>\n<li>Sharing information with those who would benefit, including updating Quest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Relationship Building:</em>  Deepens knowledge of the candidate pool and access to senior executives while proactively increasing internal visibility, awareness of expertise, and the ability to contribute on best teams as measured by Practice Leader and Research Director feedback in a matrix environment beyond immediate assignment responsibilities.  The successful candidate will do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building an internal and external network in a thoughtful, strategic manner, ahead of needing it through a genuine interest in others and willingness to be helpful in addressing their needs over time without expectation of rewards.</li>\n<li>Building trust and credibility with key people in his/her core network by being generous with his/her time and assistance, connecting people to others who might help, remembering things that are important to the person, and identifying areas of common interest.</li>\n<li>Planning for and setting aside time for relationship building activities, including being opportunistic in identifying and using any and all opportunities to connect with his/her network and further his/her aim of building visibility and gaining knowledge.</li>\n<li>Seeking out and working with others who have complementary strengths beyond those most often worked with, offering his/her help and ideas and incorporating their input and expertise.</li>\n<li>Having a genuine interest in the development of others and offering his/her coaching as and when appropriate.</li>\n</ul>","location":"Warsaw,

You care about and are <strong>proud</strong> of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.</p><br /><p><strong>T</strong>est-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use \"lack of time\" as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.</p><br /><p>You are a <strong>team player</strong>. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.</p><br /><p>As a <strong>passionate</strong> developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.</p><br /><p>As part of the learning process, you consider it important to <strong>share</strong> what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.</p><br /><p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job <strong>without being religious&nbsp;</strong>about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms, user interface libraries and development environments.</p><br /><p>You understand and embrace <strong>Agile</strong> processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.</p><br /><p>You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of <strong>SOLID</strong> principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and <strong>D</strong>omain-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>esign to design applications that reflect the business domain.</p><br /><p>If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are <strong>definitely interested in hearing from you</strong>.</p><br /><p><strong>Expected From a Crafts[wo]man at Codurance</strong></p><br /><p>We&nbsp;expect you to:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>build well-crafted bespoke applications for our clients,</li><br /><li>lead by example: you strive to work at your best, you don't cut corners, and you always behave with professionalism, regardless of which environment you are in,</li><br /><li>work with fellow craftsmen and our clients, helping them to get better at delivering quality software,</li><br /><li>mentor apprentices: helping those with less experience along their own journey in becoming a craftsman,</li><br /><li>become proficient in multiple languages and technologies,</li><br /><li>give something back to the community, writing articles, sharing code, giving talks, running workshops, and participating in external technical communities, especially the <a href=\"http://londonswcraft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC)</a>, and</li><br /><li>be humble, always respecting, sharing knowledge with, and learning from developers and others in the software industry, regardless of their skill and experience, whether they are part of Codurance or not.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Advantages of Being a Crafts[wo]man at Codurance</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Exposure to many different projects, clients, industries, and technologies.</li><br /><li>Being part of an amazing team of craftsmen, which guarantees that you will always be learning.</li><br /><li>Working for a company with a flat structure, with no managers, no architects, and no team leaders.
