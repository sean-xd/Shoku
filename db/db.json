We pride ourselves in providing top-notch support and guidance, so being able to communicate effectively with empathy and compassion is a must.\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect position for a motivated learner who wants to gain experience within a vibrant team focused on building an intuitive and customer-focused product. Spending time with our customers and product will let you interact with all sorts of interesting characters and will help you grow into a high-end distributed systems engineering position (we need those too, so if you start on support and do a great job, there is a huge amount of room for growth).\r\n\r\nWe're a distributed team and we work across many different time zones. If you're a night owl, an early riser, or somewhere in between, we're happy to accommodate untraditional work schedules -- our worldwide customers often need help at odd hours!\r\n\r\n**Technical bits we hope you're good at (or can become good at):**\r\n\r\n* Databases: We provide production-grade databases to our customers. Hopefully you've navigated a few, even if it was Visual FoxPro.\r\n* Linux: You'll want to know vmstat from sysstat and iftop from iotop. You should be comfortable with a text editor (vi, emacs, nano, makes no difference) and be able to grep | sed | awk your way through a mess of log files.\r\n* A language: They're not just for humans anymore! Ruby, Go, Python, JavaScript, Haskell... chicken!? Whatever works. We interface with developers every day, and the support team itself is a team of devops, system engineer, and developers. You'll be happiest if you can poke through someone else's code, and maybe hack out a little bit of your own.\r\n* Communication: You should like to communicate with people. Human-focused communication of technical things - it's a delicate balance!\r\n* Creative Problem-Solving: You'll face a wide range of weird, wild problems.\r\n\r\n**We're excited to see what sort of character will wind up in this role... a few helpful traits include:**\r\n\r\n* Patient: You'll deal with many crisis-like situations. Being able to stay cool under fire is essential.\r\n* Driven: We're a self-managing organization that gives you the respect, trust and responsibility to operate with minimal oversight.\r\n* Compassionate: Compose is stuffed with many great hearts, minds, and spirits. We'd love for you to want to collaborate and grow with them.\r\n* Inventive: You'll need buckets of creativity to help you solve a wide range of (sometimes vague) conundrums.\r\n* Accepting: Freedom to fail! Things won't always work, but things will always iterate. This is a fun role and should feel that way.\r\n\r\nCompose implements blind-hiring! Merit based, objectively graded work samples are the first step. We have worked hard to minimize our own biases as much as possible and find the best possible humans for the team. We respect a fancy education or a list of spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing is more impressive than the right combination of ingredients - which you can objectively demonstrate.\r\n\r\nAt any time during the process, we are available to chat (email, video, whatever you like) to ensure you are comfortable with the process and feel that you're being treated fairly and with respect.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n**Please note: At this time we are only able to accept candidates in the United States, Canada, and the UK.**","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/18167","source":"remoteok","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","python"]},{"date":1468598131000,"title":"Full Stack Web Developer","company":"Six-to-start","content":"__Location:__ Gospel Oak, London\r\n\r\n__Type:__ Full Time\r\n\r\n__Experience:__ 2+ years\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a full stack web developer.\r\n\r\nOur flagship games, Zombies, Run! and The Walk, combine innovative real-world gameplay with captivating stories and design.

You discover Marco is working on a story which is becoming more and more complex, so you help him keeping things simple and at the same time aligned better with the business case. After the stand up you sit beside Rafael who is having troubles working on a Google Analytics API client. You try to understand what is exactly the problem and with your help, Rafael come up with a new approach on how to solve the problem.</p><br /><p>You meet a candidate over lunch. You aren&rsquo;t looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality match with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It&rsquo;s your shot at filtering out candidates that don&rsquo;t fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now. Of course, your senior team members will pick her apart technically later.</p><br /><p>In the afternoon, you have a face to face sync with Rafael. You ask if the new approach for the API client is working. Then you talk about what he will be focusing on the upcoming months. He has no clear idea about that and so you ask him questions about which epic motivates him the most and which task he prefers. Rafael has a clearer idea now about his focus and he will think how to keep attention in this.&nbsp;<br>Since you have no more meetings in the day, you propose a table tennis tournament with the whole team. The team loves that and even if you lose all of the matches, you have a great time.<br><br><strong>Team</strong><br>You'll work with one or two cross functional teams formed by backend and frontend Developers, UX designers and a Scrum Master.

Considering the large amount of simultaneous, relatively small requests these services process, Node.js seemed the obvious choice. So you had to abandon your usual work field of PHP and give the old Javascript another chance. Once again it proved itself a powerful language, capable of building beautiful stuff.

In a time-starved world where shopping often feels overwhelming, our business connects customers to clothes they love. Whether it’s helping someone dress for success at a new job or taking the stress out of packing for a family vacation, we fix clients’ closets – and they love us for it!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve built unique, innovative software for merchandising, warehouse and inventory management, remote styling, and logistics. We leverage vast amounts of client data to make decisions throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our clients and a very successful business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we’re looking for incredible people to contribute!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n\n<p>Product is our primary concern. We hire engineers with great Product instincts because we are also the Product team. Building great software is a collaborative effort, so we work directly with stakeholders in the business. We deliver products &amp; solutions—not features—because we understand how Stitch Fix works and are trusted to focus our time and effort where they are needed most.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for an experienced principal full-stack engineer who has built or worked heavily on a couple of Rails applications and has some other MVC framework experience. You want to help lead a team to success.</p>\n\n<p>You love talking to your clients &amp; users about what you can build for them. You are interested in how Stitch Fix works as a business, not just in the technology, and you would like a chance to make it work even better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We get excited about Principal Engineers who have…</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Management Experience</em></strong> — you have at least two years experience managing a team of engineers &amp; you enjoy developing their careers. In this role you will spend the majority of your time writing code but you must have a definite interest in managing engineers and engineering projects</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Project Management</em></strong> — you possess solid experience managing engineering projects and processes.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Real Tech Fluency</em></strong> — you can build anything with anything, and you probably have several years software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. You can learn from us, and we can learn from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Great Communication Skills</em></strong> — you aren’t just great at listening, speaking, and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Product-Centric Thinking</em></strong> — you have opinions about how the product you’re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company, and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Self-Directed Working Style</em></strong> — once you’ve got something, we don’t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn’t have Project Managers or Product Managers, so we take ownership of what we build.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect for the Craft</em></strong> — you build software sustainably, using modern techniques. You are always looking for more and better ways to write software and are willing to share them with your team.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect, Empathy &amp; Humility</em></strong> — you take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect, regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if you’re already a Stitch Fix superfan!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience working collaboratively as a team</em></strong>—we use GitHub, Heroku, Slack, Screen Hero, and Blue Jeans to get stuff done online. We’re more interested in your personal process for collaboration than specific technologies but are always on the lookout for better ways to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Good at prototypes and design discussion</em></strong>—experience using pull requests, one-pagers, or screencasts to create rapid prototypes that demonstrate new features</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience with testing and CI</em></strong>—we&#39;re working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests and use CircleCI to bring it all together.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience or interest in distributed, service-oriented architecture</em></strong>—we’re using tools like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, and headless HTTP services to scale our team and software.

We’re doing it by bringing the latest technology and design from outside healthcare to reimagine the way employers get value out of their data.

IT has always been asked to do more with less, to improve its integration with business goals and to ensure the ongoing quality of IT services. With the rise of mobile technology, the cloud and an \"app\" mentality, IT is being asked to do all that and more at breakneck speed. While devices and applications are being introduced faster than ever before, it is the service behind the technology that is still most important to the customer. As a result, IT will always need to manage its services and IT Service management (ITSM) practices and processes will always be necessary. The challenge is adapting service management practices to changing times so they can enable IT to go faster and deliver more ongoing value to the customer.</p><br /><p>Processes are even more critical than before for the success of our IT organization:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>They help facilitate a common understanding of the current environment we are working in. Although this may seem superfluous to some, formally documenting the processes currently used within the organization will lead to many interesting conversations about how things should really work and, ultimately, to a shared understanding of exactly what we are engaged in and how we execute our day-to-day work.</li><br /><li>They help to identify areas of improvement either through targeted automation or wide-scale process reengineering.</li><br /><li>They help identify problem areas that the organization doesn't yet address or that the organization is very weak in.</li><br /><li>They provide important information to teams helping them scope their work correctly and in the right direction, in line with the business demands.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Within ING, we have noticed that in time process knowledge, adherence to the process and process performance have been in a downward spiral.

But weâve got an established workflow down that helps make sure weâre setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Though every project is different, hereâs the gist of our QA flow:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ol><li><strong>Kickoff meeting.</strong> Just a kickoff â meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><strong>Preparing docs.</strong> Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><strong>Review approved comps. </strong>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, youâll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><strong>QA walkthrough.</strong> Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, youâll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Prepare QA checklist + test plan. </strong>After seeing each component of the site in action, youâll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what youâre planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><strong>Heavy duty testing. </strong>Youâll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer.
