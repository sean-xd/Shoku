The campus offers a free commuter bus service, on-site nursery, and subsidised gym and restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>Our staff are very diverse, from patient, detail-oriented coders to experimental early adopters, and work at the interface of biology and computer science. One quality they all share is a natural ability to collaborate and bring out the best in one another.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What are we looking for?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Have you worked in software development, software design, database design and automation? Have you processed large datasets in a production environment? We look at experience first. Most of our technology jobs also require a bachelor’s degree or higher in Computer Science or another relevant field, or equivalent experience.</p>\n\n<p>Skills in demand include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Programming languages: compiled language (Java/C/C++/C#) and/or scripting language (Perl/Python/Ruby);</li>\n<li>API design (programmatic and HTTP/RPC based);</li>\n<li>Databases: RDBMS (Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB/ElasticSearch/Neo4j/Virtuoso/Solr); writing queries (SQL or domain-specific languages) and designing new schemas;</li>\n<li>Unix/Linux command line, shell scripting and common command-line tools;</li>\n<li>Development tools: Git, issue tracking software;JavaScript/Html/CSS/NodeJS. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will need to be familiar with best practices in software design, and &#39;traditional&#39; compute-farm \nprocessing (LSF/SGE) or next-generation processing frameworks (Hadoop/Luigi) will be an advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Good communication is crucial to the success of our projects, so you need to be able to maintain good working relationships and build new ones. The ability to work independently, efficiently and within defined deadlines is expected, but what we are really looking for is commitment to delivering high-quality public services for the advancement of science. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What can I expect?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>EMBL-EBI offers a highly competitive salary and benefits package, including a generous holiday allowance, comprehensive health insurance and pension, educational and other family-related benefits where applicable, as well as financial support for relocation.

Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if:</p>\n<p>You care deeply about building products that simplify the lives of millions of people through automation.</p>\n<p><strong>About You</strong></p>\n<p>You love building new things. Most of what you’ll do each day is guiding, building and maintaining Zapier&#8217;s core workflow engine. This is a full-stack position, so you’ll work in the Zapier codebase, backend and frontend tech, our developer platform and more. Zapier is built on Python, Django, React, node.js and AWS. We use modern tools, which means you’ll have the opportunity to work with software like Memcache, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper, Docker, Redis, Jenkins, Puppet, Ansible and much more.</p>\n<p>You have worked with teams before on large Python projects. You’re also familiar with frameworks for several languages like React/Backbone.js and/or Django/Flask. You also understand how to design systems in a distributed manner across hundreds (and even thousands) of servers &#8211; we deal with 100s of millions of API calls every week and growing fast.</p>\n<p>You love shipping to customers. Your engineering projects will focus on understanding customers&#8217; needs and translating those needs from product specs into functional, production ready code. You&#8217;ll have the opportunity to ship code daily that will be used by millions of people.</p>\n<p>You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.</p>\n<p>You love learning. Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy playing with new tech and exploring areas that you might not have experience with yet.</p>\n<p>You love to set your own course. You will have a team meeting and a one-on-one meeting every week where you can help direct the course of your projects. You&#8217;ll have a direct impact on what we work on next.</p>\n<p><strong>Things You&#8217;ll Do</strong></p>\n<p>Zapier is a startup, so you&#8217;ll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you&#8217;ll probably do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help scale a fast growing and unique system &#8211; our workflow engine connects with hundreds of APIs across thousands of servers</li>\n<li>Plan and build product features &#8211; directly impact how our customers can be more productive</li>\n<li>Ship to millions of users every day</li>\n<li>Work with hundreds of different API integrations</li>\n<li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts</li>\n<li>Help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p>\n<p>Location: Planet Earth</p>\n<p>If you want to work remote, that&#8217;s cool. If you want to work near others, that&#8217;s cool too. The Zapier Product Engineering team has members across the United States, Canada, and UK.</p>\n<p>Compensation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salary (we don&#8217;t use remote as an excuse to pay less)</li>\n<li>Great healthcare + dental + vision coverage</li>\n<li>401k retirement plan with 4% company match</li>\n<li>Profit sharing</li>\n<li>14 weeks paid leave for new parents</li>\n<li>2-3 annual company retreats to awesome places</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pick your own equipment. We&#8217;ll set you up with whatever laptop + monitor combo you want plus any software you need.</p>\n<p>Unlimited vacation policy (plus we insist you take at least 2 weeks off each year—this isn&#8217;t a vague policy where unlimited vacation means no vacation).</p>\n<p>Work with awesome companies around the world. We partner with the best software makers in the world and you&#8217;ll constantly get to interact with people from <a href=\"https://zapier.com/zapbook/apps\">great companies</a>.</p>\n<p>Set your own destiny. Grow as an individual and professional.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n<p>Applying is fairly straightforward, but a bit unique. Creativity is certainly encouraged.

You’ll define the approach for the whole lifecycle – leading a small team of Software Developers and supervising less experienced Engineers – to deliver work of the highest quality. As a senior member of the team, you’ll be given the freedom to use your judgement and creativity to get work done, while nurturing the supportive and collaborative work environment we pride ourselves on.  </p>\n\n<p>We have a range of Software Engineering Roles to specialise in. These include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Windows Developer – Platform Security </li>\n<li>Cross-platform Developer – Messaging &amp; Data Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Windows Application and Web Developer</li>\n<li>Mobile Applications Developer </li>\n<li>Cross-platform Developer – Telecommunications </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your profile</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Practical knowledge of software engineering (that is, requirements capture, system analysis, design for test)</li>\n<li>Proven experience in application or kernel development for one or more of Windows, Linux, macOS, Android or iOS</li>\n<li>Proficiency in one or more of C, C++, C#, Java or Objective-C</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While not essential, a relevant degree or Masters (or equivalent experience) will really make you stand out. And so would knowledge of networking and communications, data integrity and information, along with experience of mentoring staff in a software development environment. </p>\n\n<p>Rewards\nWe’ll invest in your future, as we’re keen to see you stretch your potential too. Technical training programmes, professional accreditations, mentoring and on-the-job-development are just some of the ways we’ll do this. You can also look forward to a great rewards package and a welcoming, modern workplace that has a cafe, gym and nursery. Flexible working will also be considered. </p>\n\n<p>To find out more and to apply, please visit our site.</p>\n\n<p>*If you are relocating to the area then we can discuss the possibility of a relocation package.</p>\n\n<p>To apply to HMGCC you must be a born or naturalised British citizen, over 21 years old and primarily have lived in the UK for the last ten years.

We build custom apps; perform geospatial analysis; manage several open source civic software projects (DistrictBuilder ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/\">http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/</a> ), OpenTreeMap ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/\">http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/</a> ) and others ( <a href=\"http://github.com/azavea/\">http://github.com/azavea/</a> )); and develop an open source, high performance computing framework, GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io\">https://geotrellis.io</a> ), that enables us to build fast analytical applications by distributing the geospatial data processing. Our developers work across the technology stack from database and application servers in the infrastructure layer to modern, browser-based front-ends.</p>\n\n<p>The Geospatial Insights Team</p>\n\n<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data. The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product teams or professional services teams. The Geospatial Insights team works on a couple of custom software projects, but its current primary focus is on developing three leading edge SaaS products: HunchLab ( <a href=\"http://www.hunchlab.com/\">http://www.hunchlab.com/</a> ), a web application for forecasting of geographic crime risk; Raster Foundry, a toolkit for processing aerial and satellite imagery at scale; and ModelLab, a spatial data processing framework. HunchLab is sold as a SaaS product to law enforcement agencies and applies a mix of clever software, statistics, machine learning and AWS clusters to create a powerful analysis tool that is being used to improve public safety in communities around the world. The other two products are just beginning development and are funded by research grants from the US Department of Energy and NASA, respectively. The Geospatial Insights team is particularly strong with Javascript, Python, R, Scala, Spark, PostgreSQL, and architecting solutions for the AWS platform.</p>\n\n<p>With the new research grants, we are looking to grow the team, and we need your help to scale up our development capacity.</p>\n\n<p>What You’ll Do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement application code, APIs and web or mobile clients based on wireframes and designs developed by our UI/UX Design team. </li>\n<li>Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to database design, architecture, development, testing and deployment. </li>\n<li>Optimize database, server and client performance to create applications with both functional and responsive user experiences. </li>\n<li>Build, provision, and deploy servers in a repeatable way to AWS. </li>\n<li>Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to build and support scalable web applications in Python/Django, or another MVC framework (C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, Java/JVM/Spring, Scala/Play). We do a lot of work in Python/Django, Javascript, and Scala and dabble in others depending on client and project requirements. </li>\n<li>Demonstrate fluency in core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and contemporary Javascript libraries like jQuery, React, or AngularJS. </li>\n<li>Express solid understanding of MVC architecture, RESTful design patterns, and the DRY principle. </li>\n<li>Be comfortable managing VMs and working in a Linux environment. </li>\n<li>Be interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects. </li>\n<li>Get excited about a diversity of both projects and technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get extra points for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background in math and statistics or experience with R. </li>\n<li>Experience with open source or commercial geospatial toolkits like OpenLayers, Leaflet, GeoServer, PostGIS, CartoDB, ArcGIS, and GoogleMaps. </li>\n<li>Experience with mobile apps (Objective C, Android or responsive HTML). </li>\n<li>Experience scaling apps within AWS. </li>\n<li>Experience provisioning servers with Ansible. </li>\n<li>Knowledge of distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc. </li>\n<li>Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we don’t say “X-Y years of experience” or “M.S. in Computer Science.” Formal credentials like these are not irrelevant, but we are primarily looking for people who have had experience successfully building sophisticated web applications. You might have had these kinds of experiences without a college degree. Or you may be just out of school but worked your way through school and had some great co-op experiences. Or you might have a math or humanities background but a have a great head for software development. These are all potentially great backgrounds, and we’d be interested in hearing from you.</p>\n\n<p>Office and Benefits</p>\n\n<p>Our Philadelphia office is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, a shower and lockers. It’s an open office plan with several smaller rooms for team meetings, private space and concentration time. You get a top-end Linux workstation, Mac or Windows laptop with a pile of memory for VMs and extra monitors. We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule. After the first six months, our developers can also spend up to 10% of their time on a geospatial open source, professional development, or R&amp;D project. For example, some of our colleagues are contributors to the PostGIS ( <a href=\"http://postgis.refractions.net/\">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a> ), OpenLayers ( <a href=\"http://openlayers.org/\">http://openlayers.org/</a> ), GDAL ( <a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/\">http://www.gdal.org/</a> ) and GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io/\">https://geotrellis.io/</a> ) projects. Other research projects have included improving dev ops tool chains; using FFT ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform</a> ) for fast kernel density estimation ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density</a> ); working with Spark to develop machine learning tools; and using GPUs for faster raster data processing. Once a quarter, we all get together to share our research and learning with our colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/\">http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/</a> ) that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children </li>\n<li>Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance </li>\n<li>Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not </li>\n<li>Retirement plan with matching percentage </li>\n<li>Almost 4 weeks paid vacation plus additional paid sick/personal time off </li>\n<li>Family and medical leave </li>\n<li>Flexible work schedule </li>\n<li>Paid maternity and paternity leave </li>\n<li>Child care subsidy </li>\n<li>Paid time off for voting and volunteering </li>\n<li>Education assistance plan </li>\n<li>Student loan assistance </li>\n<li>Public transit and biking reimbursement plans </li>\n<li>Monthly guest lectures with lunches on the house </li>\n<li>10% time for Research or Training Projects </li>\n<li>Profit-sharing bonus plan </li>\n<li>Financial transparency through an open book policy </li>\n<li>Kind, capable and thoughtful colleagues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We welcome qualified candidates from all walks of life and value diversity in our company, and we prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status, military service, disability unrelated to job requirements, marital status, or domestic partner status.</p>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/f95be01e-871e-11e6-8958-59c1698d958d","source":"github","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","aws","rails","python","android","react","angular",".net","java"]}],"latest":1475247815000},{"name":"https://www.ppro.com/","jobs":[{"date":1475246870000,"title":"BI Developer","company":"https://www.ppro.com/","content":"<p>We&rsquo;re looking for Junior Business Intelligence (BI) Developer to become part of the Business Intelligence Team in Munich.

Depending on your background, a specification could also be added to your title; e.g., &apos;Visual Design&apos;, &apos;Interaction Design&apos;, etc. <br><br>JOB DESCRIPTION<br>First and foremost, having great oral and written skills can be a cliche, but for us it is a lifeblood. Our specialty is communicating user experience. Awesome visual &amp; interaction design is a starting point. Communicating that design amongst ourselves, and most importantly to the clients, is key to our success.<br><br>This role would primarily involve visual &amp; interaction design across a broad set of projects. Our clients range from enterprise to consumer, Fortune 500 to unfunded start-ups. Products include software apps, mobile apps, websites, technical tools, hardware, medical devices, services, spaces, public transportation, asteroids (yes, asteroids), and more. Broad UX skill-sets are a must. We specialize in complexity, whether that is in the product itself, the domain, user population, idea, actual design, etc. Deeply understanding our client&#x2019;s needs and reducing it to the compellingly simple is a common thread of our work. <br><br>While &quot;visual &amp; interaction design&quot; is the label for the primary role, we very much understand the Hunting the Unicorn conundrum (search for that and Design Staff, Google Ventures, if you haven&apos;t read that great blog). Basically, all designers are unique. You may have an art, political science, journalist, industrial design, or database administrator background. Or you may have very direct educational and training background. Either way, now, through experience, you can demonstrate yourself as a great designer in some fashion. If this sounds like you, please read on. <br><br>JOB QUALIFICATIONS<br>* Knowledge and skills in visual and interaction design. Wireframes, graphic artwork, design specifications, functional prototypes, concept designs, etc. You should be able to show us work samples that demonstrate your passion for design and breadth of ability.<br><br>* Ideally you have &#x2018;big company&#x2019; experience. Many of our clients require a certain level of &#x2018;big company&#x2019; professionalism and design detail (in fact, many of them are actually big companies). Having said that, your ability to take all that you know and fit it to a super-charged fast-as-we-can early-stage start-up client is important as well. One size does not fit all.<br><br>* Technically adept with a variety of software products. We are constantly testing new software for clients, from top-end enterprise to mobile consumer products. We are also expected to deliver results across a variety of publishing formats; e.g., simple reports, web delivery, video, etc.<br><br>* Well-versed in &quot;user research and usability&quot;. Given that we wear many hats, no one will be designing in a cave. User research and usability is a core business driver for us. You must be able to participate in these activities.<br><br>* Some more technical skills. What exactly? Who knows; you tell us. There&apos;s something you do, can build, or know about that is interesting to you and that we&apos;d like to hear about.<br><br>* A degree in a design-oriented specialization is required.

We have one ambition:<br> <em>To make online shopping simple.</em></p><br /><p>In March 2014 investors backed this vision to the tune of $1m in 24hrs on the crowdfunding site, Seedrs. We followed up with a similar round in autumn 2015.</p><br /><p>With this backing and our drive and determination we are making it simpler for consumers to get what they want, and simpler for big retailers to find their new customers. We have an awesome team, work in a fun environment and are tackling the biggest issues in shopping which affect hundreds of millions of consumers.</p><br /><p><strong>How we are solving this problem.</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re building technology that enables the big stores to operate as a single digital marketplace, with all of the advantages of a marketplace for smaller retailers (think Amazon and Etsy); 1 stop shop, easy comparison, single checkout. <br> <br> To do this we need to first amalgamate 3 million products from the top 200 retailers and make sense of them. We need to understand what a product is, it&rsquo;s true availability (sizes, in stock), how it relates to other products (for comparison) and who to show it to (relevance). Then we need to make those products simple to buy, from multiple retailers, with one click.</p><br /><p><strong>The Tech</strong></p><br /><p>We achieve this using various search, image recognition, macro, AI and API technologies. Over the past six months we have built a robust, horizontally-scalable and performant back-end infrastructure that processes over 3 million items per day.</p><br /><p>Octer's tech stack is run on a LEMP architecture with performance and security improvements earned by integrating LXC virtual containers, job publish/consume processing and search indexing. All our code is integrated using a continuous integration pipeline initialised by hooks from Bitbucket into our Jenkins CI server.</p><br /><p>We operate on an Agile software development practice around GIT and JIRA, and implement a custom take on Git Flow branch management. All our code is tested, integrated and seamlessly deployed to our network of virtual servers in the cloud, real time.</p><br /><p>*Please note, this is an onsite role only*</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/123610/php-developer-octer","source":"stackoverflow","location":"London, UK","tags":["developer"]}],"latest":1474646342000},{"name":"Quotacom","jobs":[{"date":1474646099000,"title":"Senior Systems Engineer/Devops with Big Passion for Big Data","company":"Quotacom","content":"<p>Passionate about Big Data?

Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.&nbsp;</strong>What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.<strong></strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Location</strong><br /></div><div>Work from anywhere in the&nbsp;<strong>US or Canada</strong>; if you are in&nbsp;<strong>Central or South America</strong>, letâs talk.

Or, perhaps you're an experienced fan of a particular database and want to share your praises (...or foreboding...) with the masses?\r\n\r\nIf you're technically inclined - programming, analytics, technical marketing - and want to stay comfortably plugged in to the software world, we would love to hear from you. At Compose, quality technical content is a major part of what we do. Our articles, how-tos, case studies and marketing materials are a crucial piece of our overall puzzle. If you'd love to spend your days growing with a fantastic, casual and close-knit team, we have an unbelievable spot for you.\r\n\r\nCompose has grown into a vibrant work environment where folks can feel comfortable being themselves, living a balanced life. We welcome you to enjoy comfort when taking risks, collaborate with spirited peers, and to unleash your creative personality.\r\n\r\n**Technical things we hope you're good at (or can become excellent at):**\r\n\r\n* Databases: We provide databases as a service. We'd love for you to have all sorts of experience with different types of data-storage.\r\n* Dev-y Things: It would be helpful if you can git, script, code things, and work with common software tools like Slack, Ghost, Google Analytics and Segment. The more technical know-how and experience, the better. Our stack is built with Ruby/Go and it would be excellent if you could contribute to that, too.\r\n* Tech Talk: Distill complicated technical ideas to any audience. It's a tough thing to do!\r\n\r\n**We're excited to see what sort of character will wind up in this role... a few helpful traits include:**\r\n\r\n* Driven: We're a self-managing organization that gives you the respect, trust and responsibility to operate with minimal oversight.\r\n* Compassionate: Compose is stuffed with many great hearts, minds, and spirits. We'd love for you to want to collaborate and grow with them.\r\n* Inventive: You'll need buckets of creativity to help you solve a wide range of (sometimes vague) conundrums.\r\n* Accepting: Freedom to fail! Things won't always work, but things will always iterate. This is a fun role and should feel that way.\r\n\r\n**Think you're a match?**\r\n\r\nCompose implements blind-hiring! Merit based, objectively graded work samples are the first step. We have worked hard to minimize our own biases as much as possible and find the best possible humans for the team. We respect a fancy education or a list of spectacular previous accomplishments, but nothing is more impressive than the right combination of ingredients - which you can objectively demonstrate.\r\n\r\nAt any time during the process, we are available to chat (email, video, whatever you like) to ensure you are comfortable with the process and feel that you're being treated fairly and with respect.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and have fun!\r\n\r\n**Please note: At this time we are only able to accept candidates in the United States, Canada, and the UK.**","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/19170","source":"remoteok","tags":[]}],"latest":1474031960000},{"name":"Io - Interactive","jobs":[{"date":1474031848000,"title":"AI Programmer to work on Hitman","company":"Io - Interactive","content":"<p>Are you up for a great challenge?

Steeds meer taken worden gedecentraliseerd, terwijl tegelijkertijd de middelen afnemen. Publieke spelers en marktpartijen raken steeds meer verweven en de overheid vraagt meer eigen verantwoordelijkheid en zelfredzaamheid van de burger. De overheid zal dienstverlening regisseren in plaats van die helemaal zelf te leveren, en zal maatschappelijke initiatieven vanuit de burger en de markt steeds meer faciliteren.<br>PinkRoccade Local Government biedt overheidsorganisaties een integraal platform voor gegevenslogistiek &amp; informatievoorziening met de naam Makelaarsuite. Makelaarsuite biedt gemeenten alle benodigde functionaliteit om gegevens over burgers en bedrijven uit te wisselen tussen de gemeentelijke afdelingen en met externe organisaties zoals waterschappen, belastingkantoren en Jeugdzorg. De toegevoegde waarde van Makelaarsuite is dat gemeenten altijd in staat zijn gebruik te maken van de juiste en actuele gegevens, waardoor de kwaliteit van de dienstverlening naar burgers en bedrijven toeneemt. Makelaarsuite biedt daarnaast functionaliteit om gegevens om te zetten in informatie. Dit gebeurt met behulp van business intelligence achtige analyses, linked data toepassingen en in de toekomst ook big data. Met de informatie die gemeenten via Makelaarsuite beschikbaar hebben kunnen zij processen als handhaving verbeteren of bijvoorbeeld beleid maken dat beter aansluit bij de wensen van de burgers in de gemeente. Hierdoor draagt Makelaarsuite bij aan het verbeteren van de leefomgeving, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van veiligheid en zorg.<br>Om onze groei ambities te realiseren zijn wij voor de businessunit Informatievoorziening op zoek naar een:</em><br><br><em><strong>Java developer</strong></em><br><em>&ldquo;Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.&rdquo;<br></em><br><strong>Wat je op verjaardagen vertelt dat je doet:</strong><br>&ldquo;Meer dan 150 gemeenten in Nederland zijn voor de betrouwbaarheid van hun gegevens afhankelijk van 1 applicatie.

Additionally, you are only seeing a small amount of opportunities that are really possible.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>This is where ExpertsAvailableNow comes in.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>By having remote workers (digital nomads, vagabundos, telecommuters, call them what you will) post to us their expertise and show their available skills, new and immediate job openings are instantly available to them. It's a huge success. Companies hire quickly, on a whim, instead of going through a tedious hiring process, accepting applications, and so on. When companies have to choose to accept remote workers versus going the traditional HR route (interview, in person, at the office), they fall back on their resources that they know are clear. But, companies who can see the immediately available pool of talent to hire from, prefer the diversity of remote workers. Being in the right place at the right time is easier than ever with Experts Available Now</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>And there's less risk for workers and employers.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Contracts are easier to arrange, and smaller projects are no problem because the number of inquiries an expert receives keep coming in. ExpertsAvailableNow is the largest talent pool for the digital workforce, and helps clients get to the right worker at the right time.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://expertsavailablenow.com\">https://expertsavailablenow.com</a></div><div><strong></strong></div><p><strong>To apply:</strong> You can be considered for this position (and others) by creating a profile on ExpertsAvailableNow (About 10 minutes - your name is not disclosed publicly)<a href=\"https://expertsavailablenow.com/users/auth/facebook?redirect_to=/profiles/new\">https://expertsavailablenow.com/users/auth/facebook?redirect_to=/profiles/new</a>In the new profile wizard, add the phrase &quot;XAN Ready&quot; on the question, &quot;Why should a client work with you?&quot; This way we will know you have completely read our job posting.","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/19150","source":"remoteok","tags":[]}],"latest":1473777732000},{"name":"YouVisit","jobs":[{"date":1473775809000,"title":"Interaction UX Designer Mobile - Senior","company":"YouVisit","content":"YouVisit is hiring an Interaction UX Designer Mobile - Senior in New York","url":"https://dribbble.com/jobs/11658?source=feed","source":"dribbble","location":"New York","tags":["designer"]}],"latest":1473775809000},{"name":"AOL.","jobs":[{"date":1473775628000,"title":"Data Engineer  - Java","company":"AOL.","content":"<p><strong>Company Description</strong></p><br /><p>At AOL, we&rsquo;re radically redefining the world of online media.
