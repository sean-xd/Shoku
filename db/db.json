We use that term to mean, “someone who is passionate about making great design real using web technology.” This is our primary technical role, but there’s a lot more to it than writing code. Mule is compact. Everybody contributes to the overall strategy of our projects and our team.</p><p>This is the part in most technical job postings where there’d be a list of software and tech that you should be proficient in, but we want to write that list as little as you want to read it. Being a successful Mule has less to do with the tools you use, and more to do with what you do with them.</p><p>Here’s what a Design Technologist does at Mule:</p><ol><li>Prototyping. We make prototypes to validate or demonstrate design. Sometimes these are low-fidelity, for getting an idea across quickly. Other times they’re high-fidelity, and act as a final step before implementation.</li><li>Researching technology. Every client we take on comes to us with a unique set of problems and constraints. We need a combination of existing knowledge and insatiable curiosity to identify the particular solution for them—and convince them that it’s the right one.</li><li>Communicating. We are a client services studio. We are in daily contact with our clients, whether over the phone, face-to-face, or in writing. Everybody at Mule is a skilled communicator.</li><li>Evaluating design through a technical lens. Good interactive design works in harmony with technology. A good design technologist can see through an interface to its underlying logic, and correct it or clarify it as they see fit.</li><li>Making and sharing tools. We do not give designers fish. We give them fishing line. The technology team is constantly working on ways to bring designers closer to high-fidelity, client-ready code. We listen, teach, and facilitate as much as we build.</li><li>Learning. As a work culture, Mule is not about the New Hotness™. But it’s foolish to ignore the great work being done in the design and tech world around us. Part of our job is separating the wheat from the chaff to keep our work swift and modern.</li></ol><p>We care less about experience than passion and grit. The right person for this job loves to learn and to teach. They have strongly-held opinions, but can change them in the face of superior reasoning. They don’t mind having an (amiable) argument to make the team’s work better. If this sounds like you, then read on.</p>How to apply<p>Write to us with the reasons you are the right person for the job. Attach nothing! We look forward to meeting you. </p></p>","url":"https://authenticjobs.com/jobs/27994/design-technologist","source":"authenticjobs","location":"San Francisco, CA, US","tags":["designer","ios"]}],"latest":1474393602000},{"name":"Sound Transit","jobs":[{"date":1474392753000,"title":"SOFTWARE ENGINEER","company":"Sound Transit","content":"<p><strong>Sound Transit</strong><br><strong>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</strong><br><strong>Job #15-00908</strong><br><br><strong>OPENING DATE: 09/19/16</strong><br><strong>CLOSING DATE: 10/03/16, 5:00 PM </strong><br><br><strong>GENERAL PURPOSE:</strong><br>Under general supervision, serves as the technical lead to manage, develop, implement, and maintain the Agency's Web sites as easy-to-use tool for customers; functions as a technical consultant to the Agency on Web site issues; analyzes and resolves technical issues related to the Web as needed/requested; serves a source of information and consultation on matters related to website design, organization, system maintenance and updates; and performs other technical tasks as assigned. <br><br><strong>ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:</strong><br>The following duties ARE NOT intended to serve as a comprehensive list of all duties performed by all employees in this classification, only a representative summary of the primary duties and responsibilities.

It is our aim to make it as achievable for a small team of scientists to pursue an ambitious therapeutic R&amp;D initiative as it has become for a small team of programmers to develop and deploy a web-based software product.</p>\n\n<p>The Emerald Cloud Laboratory (ECL) is a web-based life sciences lab, enabling scientists to move out of the lab, and to instead conduct research remotely from a computer. It empowers scientists to specify experiments with the precision and reproducibility of code, and to abstract away the physical execution of those experiments to Emerald’s robotically-driven facility in South San Francisco. Through the ECL, the resulting experimental data is accessible in perpetuity, detailed metadata is linked and explorable, and investigators are equipped with a suite of computational tools to drive of the algorithmic components of data analysis, freeing them to focus on the insights that are uniquely derived by scientists.</p>\n\n<h2>What You’ll Do</h2>\n\n<p>The Lab Focused Software Engineer designs and develops the software systems that establish the interface to our state-of-the-art life sciences lab. Projects include: crafting the internal framework in which Emerald’s Scientific Development team works as they bring new experiments online; building applications that guide our Laboratory Operations team; creating the next version of Emerald’s Symbolic Lab Language (SLL). We’re a small team, which means it is essential for every team member to be ready to take ownership and lead projects.</p>\n\n<p>The projects in this role involve the most direct exposure to the scientific details of the ECL.

To us that means design systems and pattern libraries, marketing sites, dashboards, onboarding flows, icons, and maybe even illustration/graphics, branding/identity, and app design.</li>\n<li>You not only sweat the details, you sweat through your shirt.

But hey, if you can crank out production-ready code, even better.</li>\n<li>We have a tendency to fly by the seat of our pants when it comes to product design, so you’re either comfortable with that, or you’re someone who can whip our process into shape.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re a small company, so there are a lot of opportunities to design things...everything mentioned above plus packaging, signage, even our new office (coming early 2017).

norm</li>\n<li>Fluent in English and Polish (written &amp; spoken)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Critical Competencies for Success</p>\n<p>The Spencer Stuart Associate will have the following attributes: </p>\n<p><em>Project Management:</em>  Plans, manages and drives own efforts to identify and develop a slate of quality candidates as measured by Consultant, client and candidate feedback.  The successful candidate will do this while handling multiple projects with competing deadlines, working with individuals who have differing styles, and managing challenging expectations by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking ownership of the project by doing what is needed at all phases of the search process, anticipating next steps and not waiting to be told what to do.</li>\n<li>Constantly reassessing priorities in own workload to realign resources where/when needed and proactively offering to do the same for the wider assignment team.</li>\n<li>Being prepared, where necessary, to work longer hours and to be available out of working hours, committing to deadlines and communicating progress against them to the assignment team and/or client.  Delivering on commitments on-time or notifying as early as possible if deadlines will slip.</li>\n<li>Leveraging the power of effective assessment and validation to surface quickly and efficiently outstanding, qualified candidates.</li>\n<li>Adapting personal approach when working with clients and colleagues of varying styles by probing to uncover what is important to each and adjusting communications and approach accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Judgment and Assessment:</em>  Ensures an efficient search process and quality outcome as measured by the time to complete an assignment and client satisfaction scores by maintaining expert knowledge of a candidate pool and an associated industry or functional area.  The successful candidate will do so in an environment where clients increasingly want to meet candidates quickly, the pool of interested candidates may be limited, or the role to be filled may not be viewed as attractive in the marketplace by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using knowledge of the market, a network of contacts, research tools and own experience to help develop the search strategy, provide an informed perspective, and help write a position specification that reflects the unique client requirements.</li>\n<li>Proactively targeting and contacting the most important business leaders of today and tomorrow, by making industry and third-party source calls to build candidate pool knowledge and to collect qualitative and quantitative information, and building credibility by demonstrating own knowledge of the industry and/or function.</li>\n<li>Using own knowledge and experience to frame the right questions to elicit information from the prospect/candidate about their experience, competencies, compensation details and other relevant data, and then make sound recommendations to the consultant on the person’s relevance for the role.</li>\n<li>Maintaining awareness of current business trends, staying abreast of economic news, reading the Wall Street Journal/FT (or other relevant press for the region) and industry-specific publications and remaining intellectually curious by asking questions and continually studying the business world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Interpersonal Skills:</em>  Enhance the efficiency of assignment execution and the quality of outcomes, as measured by the client’s comments and internal metrics, in a fast-paced environment where you compete for Consultant and client attention and “mind share” and work with multiple stakeholders of varying styles by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being authentic.</li>\n<li>Listening and asking questions to clarify understanding and demonstrate knowledge.</li>\n<li>Adapting own style to suit the communication needs of the other person.</li>\n<li>Setting expectations and clarifying roles to avoid duplication of effort and wasting precious time and resources.</li>\n<li>Raising issues early and finding solutions collaboratively to avoid problems.</li>\n<li>Remaining poised when under pressure or handling unexpected challenges.</li>\n<li>Distilling information from a variety of sources, develop an informed perspective and share that with others.</li>\n<li>Conveying information in a compelling way, beyond “just the facts” that resonates with the needs and audience.</li>\n<li>Sharing information with those who would benefit, including updating Quest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Relationship Building:</em>  Deepens knowledge of the candidate pool and access to senior executives while proactively increasing internal visibility, awareness of expertise, and the ability to contribute on best teams as measured by Practice Leader and Research Director feedback in a matrix environment beyond immediate assignment responsibilities.  The successful candidate will do this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building an internal and external network in a thoughtful, strategic manner, ahead of needing it through a genuine interest in others and willingness to be helpful in addressing their needs over time without expectation of rewards.</li>\n<li>Building trust and credibility with key people in his/her core network by being generous with his/her time and assistance, connecting people to others who might help, remembering things that are important to the person, and identifying areas of common interest.</li>\n<li>Planning for and setting aside time for relationship building activities, including being opportunistic in identifying and using any and all opportunities to connect with his/her network and further his/her aim of building visibility and gaining knowledge.</li>\n<li>Seeking out and working with others who have complementary strengths beyond those most often worked with, offering his/her help and ideas and incorporating their input and expertise.</li>\n<li>Having a genuine interest in the development of others and offering his/her coaching as and when appropriate.</li>\n</ul>","location":"Warsaw,

This isn't a run of the mill MVC app. Because of this complexity, we're limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don't apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow.</p><br /><p><strong>A little about us</strong></p><br /><p>We are not a typical startup. We're the skunkworks offshoot of an existing logistics company - we founded this startup to address logistics challenges we've faced since we started that company nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our competitors face the same problems, and the industry at large isn't making much progress to solve them. So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss. We believe in solid development practices that avoid technical debt, and want to focus on product quality above all else. We also believe in independence and accountability - I'm not looking to add 'babysitter' to my job description.</p><br /><p>We've been trying to tackle these problems in some fashion for many years, but development only really picked up in the last year. Right now we've got a remote team of 10, but we're looking to build a local team here in Chicago - the complex nature of the problems and the domain means we're really going to benefit from having a solid core group with lots of facetime.</p><br /><p><strong>Our stack</strong></p><br /><p>Primarily C#.

The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality.
