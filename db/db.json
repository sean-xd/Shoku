It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard. Very hard. You can expect days in which there’s a ton to get done and not a ton of time to do it.

Our camp staffers bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>This isn’t your average summer recreation gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, but not ourselves, seriously. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Being a Galilean means jumping into action to bring camp magic to life. Depending on the day, that could mean donning a tutu for a skit, creating a gorgeous sign that highlights the Galileo Innovation Approach, or playing a board game with two campers to build connection. You’ve got to know what it means to be a vital part of a team. You’ve got to want to grow. You’ve got to like to have fun at work. You have to smile—a lot—and you have to like to laugh.

Founded in 2012 by the people behind the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats open source projects, Elastic's global community has more than 50,000 members across 45 countries, and since its initial release, Elastic's products have achieved more than 50 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power mission critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has over 350 employees in over 30 countries around the world.\r\n\r\nAs product adoption has soared within organizations ranging from the worldâs largest financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, government organizations like NASA, large technology firms like Adobe, Cisco, HP, IBM, Microsoft, and Salesforce, and innovative companies like BlaBlaCar, Facebook, Github, Netflix, Uber, Yelp and Wikipedia, demand for hosted and managed Elasticsearch solutions have increasingly been on the rise for developers and companies who want a cloud option.\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, Elastic launched Elasticsearch as a Service. Today, the Elastic Cloud (hosted on AWS) is the only hosted Elasticsearch product on the market supported by the creators and engineers of the Elastic Stack. In addition, the Elastic Cloud is the only solution fully integrated with Elasticâs X-Pack plugins (security, alerting, monitoring, graph, and reporting) and continuously aligned to the latest version of the Elastic Stack. \r\n\r\nJust like the success of our open source products, we are experiencing the same with the Elastic Cloud.

In order to do this, we work with the latest tools and technologies to support and experiment within all aspects of our design process—from research to design; from concept to implementation. Software Designers at IDEO work closely with small teams that could include interaction designers, design researchers, industrial designers, graphic designers, electrical and mechanical engineers - inventing new solutions for some of the world’s biggest challenges. We collaborate with clients ranging from bold startups with emerging technologies to some of the most well-known brands of all time.</p><h1>Why this role is important at IDEO?</h1><p>Following a “build to think” approach, front-end software developers at IDEO shine at bringing designs to life - moving beyond static screens or strategic frameworks into tangible, visceral, living creations. Colleagues in this role will design software with a diverse range of fidelity; from quick and dirty user experience prototypes designed to facilitate research interviews, to limited-scale public software pilots that have a direct impact on end-users, to sample interface animations. You will often collaborate with external partners as well - firms with specialties in specific disciplines (from AI to VR to IOS) to help move the concept into a market-ready form. Software Design colleagues have the opportunity to explore projects that span mobile to virtual reality; wearables to interactive installations. You will have one foot firmly planted in the code world, but also consider yourself a designer as well - you are happy playing in the space of conceptual direction and visual language as much as ux flow, information architecture, and front-end code.</p><h1>Once here you will:</h1><ul><li>Get the opportunity to go out in the field with your team and travel the world to build empathy for a user’s needs and discover new opportunities for design through first-hand through things like watching a surgical procedure, exploring the house of a hoarder, shadowing a single mom who works 3 jobs but still can’t make ends meet, or flying a flight simulator.</li><li>Work with people (like product designers, interaction designers, communication designers, electrical and mechanical engineers) who do things that seem like magic; together you’ll be able to prototype quickly and realistically. You will learn new approaches and discover how a wide range of skilled craft practitioners think about their work - while also sharing your own.</li><li>Debrief and discuss field research and user feedback with the design team, in order to synthesize research into meaningful design iterations.</li><li>Continually learn and apply user interface patterns, development tools and frameworks.</li><li>Work with a diverse set of stakeholders (coworkers, clients and mentors) to communicate complex concepts and complete projects.</li><li>Share techniques and approaches with other designers—from the software discipline to interaction design, and beyond.</li></ul><h1>What does IDEO offer you?</h1><p>We believe software development is a creative discipline, not an execution task. Software discipline colleagues are creative problem solvers who often employ unorthodox yet ingenious ways to push a design and experience forward. You may modify an off-the-shelf PC driving game to integrate with an automotive simulator experience or collaborate with city organizations and data scientists to access, map and visualize raw energy usage data and expose human behaviors using open APIs. This isn’t a place where structure, rules, and instructions are given to you from above - it’s up to you to design how you want to collaborate with others to bring ideas to life in a way that lets your project team test concepts with sets of users, as well as give clients a compelling tease of what the full experience could be.

There is some new development, but most of our work is maintenance-oriented. The challenge we face is to add or change features in an existing application that you didn't write without breaking existing functionality. To accomplish this, we rely heavily on automated testing encompassing both unit and integration tests.</p><br /><br /><p>TDD</p><br /><p>We are committed to Test Driven Development as an integral part of our development process. How much experience do you have with TDD? How did you discover TDD? How have you used TDD in a recent project? What problems have you faced? How did you solve them?</p><br /><br /><p>In this role you will be expected to cover as much of your production code as possible with tests. You'll be expected to work with developers and QA to make sure we have adequate automated test coverage of new work. You should have in depth of experience in TDD. You haven't just 'read about it', you've been there with your fellow developers learning what works / doesn't work and when. Other people will look to you for guidance on how we test our applications and how it should be done.</p><br /><br /><p>Continuous Integration</p><br /><p>We believe that \"it works on my machine\" is not good enough. Many software problems for organizations are deployment-related.

Have you used a build server in a previous project before? If so, which ones?</p><br /><br /><p>What kinds of issues did you encounter?</p><br /><br /><p>Software Craftsmanship</p><br /><p>We are committed to not only building software that works today, but that will remain stable in the face of change for years to come. For us, Software Craftsmanship is not about pretension, but about always doing the best job possible. We practice a \"leave it better than you found it\" attitude with legacy code, and ensure new code meets modern standards and practices.</p><br /><br /><p>We are committed to being a learning and teaching organization. We have an internship program in which we teach college students how to be professional developers. We share knowledge and ideas through pairing, weekly developer meetings, and one-on-one conversations. Your manager is your mentor, and will spend one-on-one time with you every week talking about your career and your aspirations.</p><br /><br /><p>Mentorship</p><br /><p>We are committed to improving the development team we have through the sharing of knowledge and ideas. As a Senior Engineer, you are an example to your peers on how to do things. You model the behavior and attitudes you wish your peers to emulate. As a leader, you will ensure that your team is clear about what they're building and why. You communicate best practices, ensure clear communication, and adequate test coverage.</p><br /><br /><p>Leadership and Vision</p><br /><p>As a Senior Engineer, you should have experience leading teams and projects. You will be the point person on a team, learning and understanding the business requirements. You will often be responsible for the design of solutions to problems. With this comes the requirement to effectively communicate your decisions, designs and work with your team, the business and everyone involved in the project.</p><br /><br /><p>The Role</p><br /><p>Our average team consists of two developers, 1 QA representative, and a business contact. The business is in control of feature prioritization and scheduling. The technical team estimates work and decides how the features will be implemented. The whole team signs off on the software before it is released using our automated processes. You'll pair with developers and testers to write unit and integration tests and to implement features. You'll have your changes tested in a production-like environment with a complete set of services, databases, and applications. In addition, you'll be guiding the design of the software you work on and showcasing professional development practices to others in the group along the way. You will be looked at as a leader in the group.</p><br /><p><br> We try to always do the correct thing, however we're aware that there are room for improvements, things change, technologies evolve.

That said, most of us work Monday - Friday from 9ish UTC to 6ish UTC, and ideally you’d overlap heavily with that.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We try to be as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://asyncmanifesto.org/\">asynchronous</a>&nbsp;as possible, but still feel that we need&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;“synchronicity” to work well.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Based in UTC+4 and want to work “normal hours”?

Communication is vital, especially as a distributed team, where most tools we use don’t communicate tone or body language.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Anecdata suggests that your English is probably better than you think it is.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>A desire to fix problems “properly” (not just paper over them) AND an understanding that you often&nbsp;<em>can’t</em>&nbsp;fix problems properly</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We want you to&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to build good-quality well-engineered solutions, but to know that sometimes you just need to “hack it in”. There are always tradeoffs to be made.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Experience and drive</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You don’t need to be a Senior X or Chief Y, but you do need to be capable of taking a task and owning it.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>That doesn’t mean you necessarily do all the work, but it does mean you take on responsibility for completion, and asking for help and advice as appropriate.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Specifics</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the DOM is essential and you know what a browser is capable of and what’s available to you. Knowing how to build and debug complex applications is important, as well as ensuring they perform well. You understand how to test frontend applications, and how to choose and evaluate tools to help you better do your job. Oh, and having an eye for UX can be very valuable too.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Familiarity with React and its ecosystem is important - we need you to be able to hit the ground running with our existing React-based UIs. Knowledge of the Flux Application Architecture is also important. Familiarity with Redux is useful, though not mandatory.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>A solid surface/contextual-level understanding of “the full web stack” is massively useful - we don’t expect you to know the mechanics of a DNS SOA record or the inner workings of Postgres’s HStore, but knowing the right sort of tool to use for a given task is important, as is knowing enough words to start asking helpful questions / googling the right things</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Experience with Python would definitely be useful to be able to poke the underlying services</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Closing date</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We will be taking applications until 10 January 2017.

On any given day we knock out hundreds of scrum points and work to improve the quality and functionality of a rapidly growing product and infrastructure. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re data driven and growth-focused. &nbsp;Our work directly impacts the success of the company and will be critical to our rapid growth and scale.</p><br /><p>To achieve our mission, we look for high caliber people who share the following core characteristics:</p><br /><p><strong>Grit:</strong> Resilient marathoners who finish what they start and love tackling problems of all sizes.

We&rsquo;re naturally inquisitive, ask tough questions and aren&rsquo;t afraid to ruffle feathers to find better answers.</p><br /><p><strong>Honesty:</strong> We&rsquo;re transparent and honest because that&rsquo;s the right way to treat other people. Integrity is the basis of trust, and trust is everything when you&rsquo;re creating the future together.</p><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Take ownership over testing and assuring quality of mission critical applications</li><br /><li>Produce maintainable, functional, high reliability code, procedures and tests which ensure compliance of key product functionality</li><br /><li>Ensure the technical feasibility of system architecture and design</li><br /><li>Work with the engineering team and participate in our SCRUM process</li><br /></ul><br /><br /><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><br /><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>3-5 year experience working in testing web/mobile applications</li><br /><li>An ability to always focus on the company objectives and the mission at hand.</li><br /><li>Track record of dedication to creating maintainable, functional and reliable systems, consistent demonstration of grit, rigor, curiosity, teamwork, ownership and integrity</li><br /><li>Ability to pass background check, has appropriate work authorization</li><br /><li>Honorable discharge (military only)</li><br /></ul>","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/20563","source":"remoteok","tags":["engineer","ios"]}],"latest":1483472999000},{"name":"booj","jobs":[{"date":1483472492000,"title":"Experienced Web Application Developer","company":"booj","content":"<p><strong><em>Experienced Web Application Developer - Minimum 3 years experience</em></strong></p><br /><p>Do you know how to command the power of web technology through the languages of PHP, Javascript ( jQuery, Backbone, PhantomJS), CSS (LESS, SASS), &amp; MySQL?</p><br /><p>If so, come work with our team of highly skilled individuals who maintain and operate MVC enterprise applications built in PHP.

Every day, we have new problems to solve and new theories to test. Our entrepreneurial culture is driven by our talented team of traders and programmers. At Jane Street, we don&#39;t come to work wanting to leave. We come to work excited to test new theories, have thought-provoking discussions, and maybe sneak in a game of ping-pong or two.

Six years and one billion trips later, we’ve stumbled upon something a bit bigger: a new way to help tackle congestion—one of the most serious challenges cities face today.</p>\n\n<p>Using technology, Uber makes it quick and easy for people headed in the same direction at the same time to share their journey. It’s carpooling at the press of a button. And by getting more people into fewer cars we’ve proven you can reduce congestion and pollution overtime. uberPOOL in Los Angeles, for example, cut the number of kilometers driven across town by 12.7 million and carbon dioxide pollution by 1,400 metric in just eight months in Los Angeles.</p>\n\n<p>Longer term, we’re optimistic that smartphone apps like Uber can also offer a real alternative to individual car ownership. After all, if you can press a button and get an affordable ride across town in minutes 24-hours a day, why bother to own a car? There is an alternative to a world that looks like a parking lot and moves like a traffic jam. Join Uber to help make that future possible.</p>\n\n<p>About Communications at Uber</p>\n\n<p>The most successful consumer technology companies are brilliant storytellers, who put their products—as well as the benefits of those products—front and center in every communication.</p>\n\n<p>Our communications team is responsible for telling Uber’s story to the media and third parties: whether it’s transforming how we get around town and the lives of people who value independent, flexible work; or cutting congestion in cities by getting more backsides into fewer cars. That’s partly about building lasting relationships with the key news outlets and journalists in every country where we operate. It also about being creative in how we tell our story, including using social media, as well as working with the public policy team to develop campaigns that make the positive case for reform.</p>\n\n<p>About this Role</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for someone to lead our Communications in Latin America based in Mexico city or in Sao Paulo. This role will involve:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Building an effective, credible communications team across the region;</li>\n    <li>Establishing Uber’s brand and profile with the media and third parties; and</li>\n    <li>Working to tell our story—and the story of ridesharing—in creative, inspiring ways that resonate with journalists and on social media</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What we’re looking for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Proven track record in the communications field, including leading a team or a leader in another walk of life, who intuitively gets this stuff and may be looking for a career change</li>\n    <li>A self starter: Uber is a company of entrepreneurs and we want to work with people who enjoy building things from the bottom up. Stuff changes fast in our world so you’ll need to be highly adaptable as well as calm under pressure.</li>\n    <li>A great advocate: We’re looking to create new regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and alternatives to individual car ownership.

We&rsquo;re building the next generation of software to power lean businesses. It&rsquo;s got to be fast, modular and web based. It&rsquo;s also got to be flexible since we may spin off the development team as a separate corporation in order to adapt the software to many businesses.</p><br /><p><strong>How are we building it?</strong></p><br /><p>Since we&rsquo;re at the beginning of the project, much is up for grabs! Languages? It&rsquo;s going to be web based (JavaScript and frameworks) with a Python backend. We will also continue development of several major components of the application that have already been built in C# on Microsoft&rsquo;s ASP MVC platform. We use a variety of relational databases, including MySQL and MS SQL Server, and will probably utilize some NoSQL databases , in particular, graph databases (like Neo4J), for this project.</p><br /><p>There are a myriad of architectural and design decisions to be made so if you&rsquo;re daunted by that task you&rsquo;ll probably want to pass on this opportunity.

From the factory floor to the executive team and owners (all of whom must be employees), we work in teams daily to identify gaps between what was expected and what actually occurred and to close those gaps incrementally, but resolutely.</p><br /><p><strong>Why are we building it?</strong></p><br /><p>We have tried many typical ERP solutions and discovered that they simultaneously do more than we need, don&rsquo;t do exactly what we need, are inflexible, aren&rsquo;t extensible, and are expensive.

Over the course of a few hours, you'll be fixing a bug in our app (that we've previously fixed), so we can see how you approach solving a realistic problem.\n\nPairing on a Few Potential Features\nFinally, during the pairing exercises you'll pair with one of our developers to implement an (existing) feature in the app. This will take a couple hours or so, and will mostly consist of discussion about approach, with some coding in the midst of it.\n\nDiversity\n\nEstately seeks to increase the ratio of women and underrepresented minorities in software engineering and development, we encourage women and people from underrepresented groups to apply for this position.\n\nEstately is striving to be a diverse team, made of and built by people with different backgrounds and lifestyles. We don't discriminate based on race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age, religion, color, or any other group.","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/20408","source":"remoteok","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","full stack","rails"]}],"latest":1482205122000},{"name":"Noble Digital","jobs":[{"date":1482200828000,"title":"Web Designer/Branding","company":"Noble Digital","content":"Noble Digital is hiring a Web Designer/Branding anywhere","url":"https://dribbble.com/jobs/12086?source=feed","source":"dribbble","location":"","tags":["designer"]},{"date":1482200828000,"title":"Web Designer Branding","company":"Noble Digital","content":"Noble Digital is hiring a Web Designer/Branding anywhere","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/20407","source":"remoteok","tags":["designer"]}],"latest":1482200828000},{"name":"Hylink Digital Solutions","jobs":[{"date":1482200507000,"title":"Senior Interactive Designer","company":"Hylink Digital Solutions","content":"Hylink Digital Solutions is hiring a Senior Interactive Designer in 225 Santa Monica Blvd., 8th Floor","url":"https://dribbble.com/jobs/12085?source=feed","source":"dribbble","location":"225 Santa Monica Blvd., 8th Floor","tags":["designer"]}],"latest":1482200507000},{"name":"ROOT","jobs":[{"date":1482199603000,"title":"Senior Software Engineer","company":"ROOT","content":"<p>Root is an auto insurance company, like GEICO and Progressive.</p><br /><p>We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.</p><br /><p>We're a startup &mdash; we're 17 people who have been working on this for a little over a year.

visualization and analysis, data science, commercial product development and geospatial solutions. &nbsp;In the past year our Professional Services teams have completed a variety of projects including building the SaaS platform for an award winning energy services asset management startup, building a set of citizen science mobile monitoring apps, building a new way to share environmental monitoring

business line is in the adaption to climate change space. &nbsp;Tesera has worked with a key industry associations to build a risk assessment tool that will support and assist municipalities in discovering asset vulnerabilities. &nbsp;Tesera is commercializing this product which employs a spatial machine learning approach. &nbsp;We break the landscape down into thousands of spatial indicators which can then be modeled to determine their influence on event outcomes such as infrastructure failures. &nbsp;We have a lot of work to do here to bring this to a commercial product offering and we are very excited about doing it. &nbsp;</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>High Resolution Inventory Service &nbsp;(HRIS) is our third business area. &nbsp;HRIS enables our clients who manage landscapes to have a higher level of resolution and accuracy that theyâve ever had before. &nbsp;HRIS combines LiDAR, colour infrared imagery, climate indices, terrain indices and ground plot data via machine learning processes to predict attributes about the landscape. &nbsp;The types of information that can be generated from HRIS are far-ranging from types and quality of timber resources to locations of streams, potential wildlife habitat and amount of carbon sequestration. &nbsp;The HRIS solution, creates attributes across an &nbsp;entire landscape

Starting at $15 per month, law students get access to a comprehensive database of case summaries, video lessons, practice questions, and a legal dictionary. Over the past nine years and through sheer word of mouth, we have become one of the most widely used and trusted sites for law students, serving both institutional clients, such as American University and University of Illinois, as well as thousands of individual law students.</p>\n\n<p>We’re headquartered in Charlotte, NC, but we’re big believers in remote working. Our team is spread out among Taiwan, Uruguay, and different cities in the U.S. We don’t mind where you work, so long as you’re passionate and hardworking. To stay in touch, we mostly use Google Hangouts and Slack. To stay organized, we use Pivotal Tracker and Basecamp. But overall we think we’re low bureaucracy. We use a lightweight agile process. We have a pretty much horizontal organization so everyone in our team is encouraged to bring new ideas which could drive our business in new or improved ways.</p>\n\n<p>As our site has grown, so has our need for exceptional designers and developers. We have had the privilege of working with some outstanding dev shops in the past, but we’ve moved on to building our own full-time dev team since 2014. We like small teams and we try not to grow the team unless we really feel the need. With our application growing in size, usage, and complexity, we can now see that we’re in dire need of welcoming a new versatile, experienced developer to the team. That’s where you come in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></p>\n\n<p>You must be a senior developer. Technically we’re mostly interested in your recent Ruby on Rails and general web development experience at all levels of the stack, from Angular (or similar) front end apps, to dealing with search engines, DB query tuning, and everything in between, but we’d expect you to have worked with other languages/frameworks during your career. You’ll join a very small tech team, so your voice will be heard when we need to make new technical decisions as our product grows. We expect you to go beyond coding to give input on the product roadmap, design, and architecture.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the tasks (beyond “simply” coding new features and fixing bugs) our tech team has been dealing with over the last few years so you can get a big picture of the tasks you’d be involved with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Investigate and mitigate memory bloat (we’ve used coverband, oink, skylight and other tools).</li>\n<li>Handle a layered fragment caching system via a Russian Doll caching scheme.</li>\n<li>Write scripts to automate Markdown processing and manipulation (we’ve used Pandoc having to dive a bit in Haskell).</li>\n<li>Write scripts to import content from Word documents.</li>\n<li>Constantly add new features without rewriting the app from scratch while maintaining a high level of code maintainability.</li>\n<li>Use feature toggling techniques to maintain our master branch constantly deployable to production.</li>\n<li>Maintain a sane set of automatic tests (we use Rspec and Capybara) without being dogmatic about 100% code coverage.</li>\n<li>Prepare our platform for changing our payments processing backend without stopping our service and maintaining our low level of money related bugs.</li>\n<li>Keep our Ionic Framework based mobile app updated with new features and make sure that our changes in the backend are compatible with the existing mobile app version.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Our application is currently based on these main technologies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby 2.2.x, Rails 4.2.x, Bootstrap, SASS, Ionic Framework.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of our upcoming possible tasks are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We might migrate all our payments and subscriptions related code from Chargify to Stripe. Have any related experience? Let us know!</li>\n<li>Try a new approach for our mobile app. Some alternatives could be a closer-to-the-web approach, using * Turbolinks and pure server-rendered HTML views similar to how Basecamp does it, or maybe trying out React Native? Do you have better alternatives/suggestions? Speak out!</li>\n<li>We’re considering migrating some/all of our current Angular based code to React or Elm.</li>\n<li>We’ll be adding a bunch of different dashboards with stats per user, per group of users, etc. Have any experience extracting this kind of data from a DB and/or using JS graphing libraries? Don’t forget to mention it!</li>\n<li>We’re rebuilding our search engine, so if you have experience integrating advanced search services into web and mobile apps you have extra points!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Generally speaking, you should be:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>A versatile engineer.</em> You know what you don’t know and feel comfortable learning new skills. You’re not ashamed of recognizing mistakes and take measures to avoid falling again.</li>\n<li><em>A team player.</em> We working remotely doesn’t mean you’re going to work alone. We share code-ownership as much as possible. You’ll have to fix other people’s code as much as other teammates will be fixing yours.</li>\n<li><em>A full-stack developer.</em> You have lots of experience building Rails applications, and you’re also very comfortable writing front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS).</li>\n<li><em>A minimalist.</em> You believe a new feature should be built only when the evidence supports it. You’re willing to push back when you believe this rule is being ignored or violated.</li>\n<li><em>A great communicator.</em> You communicate your ideas, feedback, and criticism thoroughly, clearly, and courteously. You believe there’s no such thing as over-explaining or over-clarifying because that’s how miscommunication is avoided.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years experience in Ruby on Rails development</li>\n<li>A CS degree, or a strong software engineering foundation demonstrated in other ways</li>\n<li>HTML5, CSS, JS fluency</li>\n<li>Know how the web works under the hood. TCP, HTTP, DNS, IP, caches, etc.</li>\n<li>Experience in a front-end framework like Ember, Angular, React or Elm</li>\n<li>Experience writing tests and refactoring. We use Rspec and Capybara.</li>\n<li>Must be very comfortable with Git and version-control. Experience solving complex merging conflicts.</li>\n<li>Strong knowledge of SQL in general and PostgreSQL in particular</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Points for experience with:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX design skills</li>\n<li>Implementing HTML5/SASS from PSD designs.</li>\n<li>Bootstrap.</li>\n<li>Hosting apps in Heroku, monitoring and scaling them up/down.</li>\n<li>Pivotal Tracker</li>\n<li>Working on a remote team</li>\n<li>Implementing a custom Ruby CMS</li>\n<li>Implementing a SaaS application or with subscription-based businesses generally</li>\n<li>A/B testing and conversion optimization, particularly tools such as Optimizely or Unbounce</li>\n<li>Implementing and/or measuring KPIs for SaaS, such as churn, LTV, and event-based analytics, particularly tools such as Mixpanel or Kissmetrics</li>\n<li>Implementing user-visible dashboards, graphing data and showing stats/analytics in general.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What We Offer:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$100K - $125k Salary</li>\n<li>Generous PTO policy</li>\n<li>$5,000 budget for workstation setup</li>\n<li>A great, stable and small team to work with</li>\n</ul>\n","url":"https://www.wfh.io/jobs/3377-senior-ruby-on-rails-developer-quimbee","source":"wfhio","tags":["developer","designer","engineer","rails","react","angular"]}],"latest":1481408963000},{"name":"Ee Steady Vision","jobs":[{"date":1481407594000,"title":"ExpressionEngine (EE) Developer","company":"Ee Steady Vision","content":"<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Small Team.
