In a time-starved world where shopping often feels overwhelming, our business connects customers to clothes they love. Whether it’s helping someone dress for success at a new job or taking the stress out of packing for a family vacation, we fix clients’ closets – and they love us for it!</p>\n\n<p>We’ve built unique, innovative software for merchandising, warehouse and inventory management, remote styling, and logistics. We leverage vast amounts of client data to make decisions throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our clients and a very successful business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we’re looking for incredible people to contribute!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n\n<p>Product is our primary concern. We hire engineers with great Product instincts because we are also the Product team. Building great software is a collaborative effort, so we work directly with stakeholders in the business. We deliver products &amp; solutions—not features—because we understand how Stitch Fix works and are trusted to focus our time and effort where they are needed most.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for an experienced principal full-stack engineer who has built or worked heavily on a couple of Rails applications and has some other MVC framework experience. You want to help lead a team to success.</p>\n\n<p>You love talking to your clients &amp; users about what you can build for them. You are interested in how Stitch Fix works as a business, not just in the technology, and you would like a chance to make it work even better.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We get excited about Principal Engineers who have…</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Management Experience</em></strong> — you have at least two years experience managing a team of engineers &amp; you enjoy developing their careers. In this role you will spend the majority of your time writing code but you must have a definite interest in managing engineers and engineering projects</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Project Management</em></strong> — you possess solid experience managing engineering projects and processes.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Real Tech Fluency</em></strong> — you can build anything with anything, and you probably have several years software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. You can learn from us, and we can learn from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Great Communication Skills</em></strong> — you aren’t just great at listening, speaking, and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Product-Centric Thinking</em></strong> — you have opinions about how the product you’re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company, and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Self-Directed Working Style</em></strong> — once you’ve got something, we don’t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn’t have Project Managers or Product Managers, so we take ownership of what we build.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect for the Craft</em></strong> — you build software sustainably, using modern techniques. You are always looking for more and better ways to write software and are willing to share them with your team.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect, Empathy &amp; Humility</em></strong> — you take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect, regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if you’re already a Stitch Fix superfan!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience working collaboratively as a team</em></strong>—we use GitHub, Heroku, Slack, Screen Hero, and Blue Jeans to get stuff done online. We’re more interested in your personal process for collaboration than specific technologies but are always on the lookout for better ways to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Good at prototypes and design discussion</em></strong>—experience using pull requests, one-pagers, or screencasts to create rapid prototypes that demonstrate new features</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience with testing and CI</em></strong>—we&#39;re working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests and use CircleCI to bring it all together.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience or interest in distributed, service-oriented architecture</em></strong>—we’re using tools like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, and headless HTTP services to scale our team and software. We’re learning as we go, so your experience or keen interest can ensure our systems handle our ever-increasing load.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You’re excited about this opportunity because you will...</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manage a team of engineers with different levels of experience: some juniors requiring mentorship, some experienced individual contributors</li>\n<li>Work directly with business partners to identify a roadmap of products, features and enhancements that will provide the most value to the business</li>\n<li>Assign roadmap projects to your team members looking for best fit of project scope and engineer ability and interest</li>\n<li>Manage a number of projects from the roadmap either those you are working on directly or being built by members of your team</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Why you will love working at Stitch Fix</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive salaries and generous equity.</li>\n<li>A business that trusts and embraces tech.</li>\n<li>A leadership team that wants to do it right and is open to new ideas.</li>\n<li>A startup with a proven business model that’s growing fast.</li>\n<li>Use your preference of tools and hardware.</li>\n<li>A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage.</li>\n<li>Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks.</li>\n<li>Sunny offices in downtown San Francisco, CA, Austin, TX and Pittsburgh, PA, or your home :)</li>\n<li>Full support for remote work—you get to visit our SF office every couple months to connect with your peers and partners.</li>\n</ul>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/e8b31520-47a9-11e6-85a6-b35ee14f6441","source":"github","tags":["engineer","full stack","rails","manager"]},{"date":1468268886000,"title":"Executive Marketing Assistant","company":"BoldLeads","content":"<div>Are you organized, creative and a self-starter?

IT has always been asked to do more with less, to improve its integration with business goals and to ensure the ongoing quality of IT services. With the rise of mobile technology, the cloud and an \"app\" mentality, IT is being asked to do all that and more at breakneck speed. While devices and applications are being introduced faster than ever before, it is the service behind the technology that is still most important to the customer. As a result, IT will always need to manage its services and IT Service management (ITSM) practices and processes will always be necessary. The challenge is adapting service management practices to changing times so they can enable IT to go faster and deliver more ongoing value to the customer.</p><br /><p>Processes are even more critical than before for the success of our IT organization:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>They help facilitate a common understanding of the current environment we are working in. Although this may seem superfluous to some, formally documenting the processes currently used within the organization will lead to many interesting conversations about how things should really work and, ultimately, to a shared understanding of exactly what we are engaged in and how we execute our day-to-day work.</li><br /><li>They help to identify areas of improvement either through targeted automation or wide-scale process reengineering.</li><br /><li>They help identify problem areas that the organization doesn't yet address or that the organization is very weak in.</li><br /><li>They provide important information to teams helping them scope their work correctly and in the right direction, in line with the business demands.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Within ING, we have noticed that in time process knowledge, adherence to the process and process performance have been in a downward spiral.

But weâve got an established workflow down that helps make sure weâre setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Though every project is different, hereâs the gist of our QA flow:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ol><li><strong>Kickoff meeting.</strong> Just a kickoff â meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><strong>Preparing docs.</strong> Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><strong>Review approved comps. </strong>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, youâll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><strong>QA walkthrough.</strong> Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, youâll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Prepare QA checklist + test plan. </strong>After seeing each component of the site in action, youâll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what youâre planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><strong>Heavy duty testing. </strong>Youâll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer.

Tens of thousands of people all over the world now use it every day to share stuff with each other. In 2015 we started Peerby Go, a rental service for stuff. Since its launch Go has grown 20% m/m, a pace that is hard but also very rewarding to keep up with.</p><br /><p>Our ideas about tech have evolved over the years and we&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s almost always best to keep things simple. It&rsquo;s not sexy, but the fewer moving parts, the faster we can iterate! We try to use Javascript wherever we can. We only introduce complexity when we really have to, e.g. in order to successfully match demand with supply, we&rsquo;ve built machine learning algorithms.</p><br /><p>So, what does a day at Peerby look like? You&rsquo;re part of a small, independent, multidisciplinary team. Each team at Peerby works on either of our&nbsp;two products, Peerby Borrow or Peerby Go, and has a clearly defined goal, for example &lsquo;improve customer satisfaction of people who order for the first time&rsquo;.
