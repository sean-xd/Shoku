At Galileo, we nurture creativity, curiosity and expression in campers, and believe in giving staff the opportunity to contribute their strengths toward the success of a program and company invested in their personal and professional growth.</p><p> </p><p>Galileo has been ranked one of the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area by the SF Business Times for six years running, and over 97% of our summer staff say they would recommend working for us. Being a Galileo Camp Director means joining an educational movement by becoming part of an organization that is a model of innovative learning in the communities we serve.  Our mission is achieved not only through working with campers each summer, but in nurturing the careers of current and aspiring educators. Our Camp Directors bring this vision to life.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Galileo Summer Programs Combine Five Important Things:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Credibility &amp; expertise:</strong>  Galileo has been in operation for over 14 years, and has partnerships with world-class organizations:  The Tech Museum of Innovation, Youth Digital, and Klutz, to name a few.  Working at Galileo means working with success and experience.</li><li><strong>Integrity and purpose:</strong>  Galileo’s mission—and how that mission is carried out through the Galileo Innovation Approach—is the backbone of the summer experience.  Join a movement of current and aspiring educators, united in a common purpose: developing innovators who envision and create a better world.</li><li><strong>The best people:  </strong>An experienced, professional, hard-working and fun staff teach unique curriculum and deliver exceptional service to Galileo clients – both families and campers.</li><li><strong>Wide appeal:</strong>  Effective, multi-faceted marketing attracts families throughout the Bay Area, Southern California and Chicago to Galileo programs.</li><li><strong>Commitment to inclusion:</strong>  An aggressive campership program which widens our impact through reserving registrations for scholarship recipients.</li></ul><p><strong>Rewards of Becoming a Galileo Camp Director</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lasting Positive Impact on Kids, Staff, Families, and Communities:  </strong>Camp Directors develop meaningful, multi-year relationships with staff members, campers and families, and inspire the spark of camp:  get kids excited about innovation, and teach them to make new friends, have fun, and build confidence.  And, each Camp Director leads a staff of exceptionally talented, fun, friendly people with whom they create something immense and lasting. In one short summer, you can become the example of leadership to which your staff will hold all future supervisors.</li><li><strong>Leadership Training &amp; Professional Development: </strong>All Camp Directors receive unique and exceptional training including: weekend management training retreats, weekly individual coaching throughout the camp season, mentorship, and access to Galileo’s network of prominent educational leaders. Camp Directors are given the tools, framework, community, and support to take ownership of and implement a fully-developed program. Also encouraged to be creative and innovative as they make camp their own, Camp Directors develop entrepreneurial skills and confidence in vision-building and program implementation.  Learn about:  grassroots marketing; staff selection, training and management; leadership; time and project management; and so much more.  Camp Directors are evaluated in June and August, ensuring the opportunity to learn from the positive and constructive feedback they receive.</li><li><strong>Opportunity:  </strong>As Galileo grows, we are always looking for Area Directors, curriculum creators, and other full-time staff. Successful Camp Directors are likely candidates for such opportunities. Galileo also has an alumni network which connects people with outstanding opportunities outside of Galileo.</li><li><strong>Financial Reward:  </strong>A first year Camp Director typically earns $10,000-$12,000, with up to 20-30% annual increases in subsequent years.

So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss.

It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.

ALEX helps companies talk their employees through the tricky choices they&rsquo;ll have to make, like picking a health insurance plan, deciding how much to put in the 401(k), or whether they might want extra life insurance. Our customers love ALEX because he helps their employees figure out what&rsquo;s best for their personal situations, which, in turn, saves our customers a boat-load of time and money - everybody wins! As we sell more and more of ALEX, we need more and more non-virtual (i.e., real life) people to keep the virtual ones amazing. That&rsquo;s where you come in.<br><br><strong>SO WHAT'S THIS JOB ABOUT?</strong></p><br /><p>To be successful in this role you must be the kind of software engineer who can turn their hand to both server-side and browser-side code and understand the ins and outs of each - a person who is looking to play with some cool technology and build some great products. Whether you got your start with a Computer Science degree, attending a boot camp, or by writing code on the side, you know what it is to write code and you love doing it.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>There's a great deal of collaboration with a diverse team (which often leads to having fun) at Jellyvision. You'll be working on a bunch of different (but related) projects at any given time. Development is a team effort at Jellyvision, and all our development teams use Scrum, which means every day involves working with product owners, Scrum Masters, QA, DevOps, and the users we have right here in the building.</p><br /><p>Jellyvision isn&rsquo;t just made up of engineers&mdash;we&rsquo;re also writers, project managers, producers, sales folks&mdash;you get the idea. In other words, you&rsquo;ll be talking to a lot of people without a strong technical background, so you will need to demonstrate a respect for smart people who aren't engineers and are able to teach them and listen to them so we can all share our successes.</p><br /><p>On a day-to-day basis, you'll be working on our products and on the tools that help the rest of the company build those products. You'll add features, fix bugs (what, bugs?! never!), test the stuff you built, and be involved in designing the next features and tools coming down the line.<br><br><strong>WHAT KIND OF TECHNICAL SKILLS SHOULD I HAVE? YOU KNOW, LANGUAGES AND SUCH...</strong></p><br /><p>Our client-side code runs on&nbsp;(surprise!) JavaScript, and our server-side code uses Ruby. You'll need to have experience with one or both of these languages.</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Javascript:</strong>We're using React and Redux most of the time, but we have a few other frameworks floating around, so if you're handy with Angular or Backbone that's fine too. What's important is that you can apply your knowledge toward writing JavaScript-based web applications.</li><br /></ul><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Ruby:</strong>&nbsp;We've worked with both Rails &amp; Grape, so we're not beholden to any particular framework. If you don't have a Ruby background but you do know PHP, Perl, Python, or Node and you've got solid fundamentals, we're pretty confident you can learn Ruby once you get here.</li><br /><li><strong>HTML &amp; CSS:</strong>&nbsp;Anyone who's done some web development will have written HTML and CSS, so bonus points if you're familiar with a templating language like Mustache or Dust or a CSS preprocessor like Less or Sass.</li><br /><li><strong>Testing:</strong>&nbsp;You should be the kind of person who tests their code as a part of writing it, whether that's TDD-style or writing them after the fact. You should know your way around a testing suite or two.</li><br /><li><strong>Source Control:</strong>&nbsp;Experience developing software with Git or some other kind of source control will benefit you greatly. If you've been using SVN or Mercurial and you're ready for something new, we're open to that. Most of your teammates will be happy to show you the ropes.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>\"SENIOR\" CAN MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS...WHAT DOES SENIOR MEAN TO JELLYVISION?</strong><br><br>If you&rsquo;re the seasoned engineer for us, you&rsquo;ve got a few years under your belt, have worked on some large projects, and have guided your team through said projects.</p><br /><p>You should have solid experience with the ecosystems of JavaScript and Ruby; modern JavaScript build pipeline, including task runners, transpilers, bundling, and so on. You&rsquo;ve got examples of clean Ruby architecture and transparent data modeling, and can handle writing database queries in SQL, as well as NoSQL tools like CouchDB. You are fearless in the face of old code (Flash, PHP).</p><br /><p>Got an eye for style or great UI/UX?&nbsp;Anything else relevant that you think makes you a rockstar senior? Tell us about it!<br><br><strong>ANYTHING ELSE?</strong></p><br /><p>Yes.&nbsp; We share&nbsp;a&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;to excellence and&nbsp;a desire&nbsp;to work in&nbsp;a comfortable,&nbsp;friendly atmosphere, so we hire nice, bright, funny&nbsp;people who are&nbsp;willing to work hard.&nbsp; Our credo is a simple one: be&nbsp;helpful.&nbsp;And&nbsp;we believe&nbsp;we can be most&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;if our&nbsp;workforce&nbsp;is as diverse in thought, perspective, and culture as the people who use our products. We&nbsp;are looking to&nbsp;add amazing folks to&nbsp;our team&nbsp;who will bring diversity across many lines, including race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, gender identity, sex, and country of origin.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;<br><strong>ARE THERE ANY PERKS? </strong>Yes, we love perks.</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Competitive pay, stock options and benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>401(k) with matching. &nbsp;And we pay 100% of the cost of premiums for medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance for our employees (as long as you qualify for our tobacco-free discount; if you&rsquo;re a tobacco user, your medical premiums will be higher than $0). &nbsp;We also cover a really nice chunk of the cost of premiums for spouse/partner/dependent medical, dental and vision insurance.</li><br /><li><strong>Casual dress and a flexible schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Come in a sweatshirt, jeans, whatever, like everyone else here.</li><br /><li><strong>Creative work environment.&nbsp;</strong>We are lucky to work in a place that is full of intelligent, talented and innovative folks. Although most hours the place is deathly quiet (we're a focused bunch), this is punctuated with hilarious outbursts and general merriment, which makes a nice way to spend the day.</li><br /><li><strong>Free food.&nbsp;</strong>Every week, we stock our kitchen with free healthy snack foods, and we have a &ldquo;hot lunch&rdquo; catered once a week to give people a reason to hang out and eat together.</li><br /><li><strong>Easy transportation.&nbsp;</strong>We&rsquo;re really close to the 'L' and the Halsted (#8) bus (right by the Apple Store and Mega Whole Foods too), and we have a transit FSA that allows you to dedicate pre-tax dollars to public transportation expenses.&nbsp;And a number of our employees like to bike to work, so we also have showers and lockers in the office.</li><br /><li><strong>Did we mention our yoga class?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We bring a pro instructor right to the office.&nbsp; Fully subsidized by Jellyvision and fully optional, btw.&nbsp;</li><br /><li><strong>Oh! And we have a massage chair.&nbsp;</strong>Not just any massage chair, my friend.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the HumanTouch HT 5320 WholeBody&trade; Massage Chair. Feeling a little stiff? Sit down. Relax. Feel better? Good.
