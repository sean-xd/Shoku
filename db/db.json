We're looking for a Software Developer to join our growing development team. If you've ever wanted to work for an innovative software company, in great environment with great people, this is your chance. We&rsquo;re a security software-as-a-service company so you&rsquo;ll be involved both in our day-to-day software development as well as getting exposure to our security efforts.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Ok. &nbsp;Who are you guys?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We&rsquo;re Wombat Security Technologies. We&rsquo;re comprised of a some really smart white hat security hackers, researchers from CMU, software developers and lot of hard working and friendly faces. We also really like pie.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What would I be working on?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> You know all those data breaches your hear about in the news? Most of them started when a bad guy targeted an employee with a phishing attack. You&rsquo;ll be working on our cloud-based SaaS user risk management and training service. Our customers are mostly large enterprise organizations that are under attack by some pretty nasty bad guys. They use our platform to deliver security education to their employees and figure out who needs extra help.Your job will be to make our customers' experience of securing their users from attack delightful and beautiful.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Can you tell me a little more about your product?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> Sure, we have several different ways that we can deliver security training to end users as well as several different ways to assess the their security knowledge. One of the really fun ways we test the user is thinking like the bad guys. We send the end users a simulated phishing message. If they fall for it (they click our link, open our attachment, etc.), we show them training right away. It's an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data). Wombat is in a growing space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and cutting-edge attacks, this is the where to do it. You&rsquo;ll get to help simulate evil, figure out how to fight evil, and give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: Where is this position located?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> Preferably you&rsquo;re located in Pittsburgh, PA where our HQ office is located in the Strip District. We&rsquo;d also like to talk if you&rsquo;re in the DC metro area, or Denver, CO. That said, we&rsquo;re open to remote (a lot of us are remote) if you&rsquo;re the right match. We value productivity and results over people&nbsp;in seats.</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What will my day-to-day be like as a developer on the team?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> You&rsquo;ll be working on a key component that have high value and visibility to the organization. It&rsquo;s a polyglot environment--you might write some C# and then jump into java, before ending the day working on some javascript. You&rsquo;ll keep in touch with the team using Slack, Google Hangouts, and even an ol' IP phone if you&rsquo;d prefer.</p><br /><br /><p><strong>Q: What hours will I work?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We work typical office hours &mdash; &nbsp;but value productivity, performance, and results: happy customers and code shipped. We&rsquo;re in a competitive space, so sometimes there are long hours. But we interests outside of work,&nbsp;so we aim for a good work-life balance. Yes, we know everyone says that but seriously, many people here have kids or super likable dogs (or the rare acceptable cat). There are occasional late nights, but we get the balance thing.<br><br><strong>Q: What technology do you use?</strong></p><br /><p><strong>A:</strong> We're built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Sample of our stack: Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren't used to seeing. Also coffee (optional but recommended).</p><br /><p><strong>Q: What benefits do you offer?</strong></p><br /><p>A: The salary is competitive and depends on your experience. We offer the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Medical, dental, and vision insurance</li><br /><li>401k with company match</li><br /><li>Time off for vacations, illness and holidays</li><br

We deal with analytics required by a variety of trading, risk management and regulatory reporting applications. The front, middle and back offices of major financial institutions involved in the USD 700 trillion derivatives industry use our products to make sense of the complexity, risks, pitfalls and regulations surrounding these financial instruments.

We build applications for discovering and analyzing market trends, aggregating and evaluating analyst predictions, and screening and back-testing investment ideas.

We cover government, corporate, money market, municipal and preferred instruments. Our clients depend on our pricing algorithms, high performance calculation libraries, trading applications and real-time big data analysis to make informed decisions.

We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we’re looking for incredible people to contribute!</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n\n<p>Product is our primary concern. We hire engineers with great Product instincts because we are also the Product team. Building great software is a collaborative effort, so we work directly with stakeholders in the business.

You can learn from us, and we can learn from you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Great Communication Skills</em></strong> — you aren’t just great at listening, speaking, and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Product-Centric Thinking</em></strong> — you have opinions about how the product you’re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company, and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Self-Directed Working Style</em></strong> — once you’ve got something, we don’t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn’t have Project Managers or Product Managers, so we take ownership of what we build.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect for the Craft</em></strong> — you build software sustainably, using modern techniques. You are always looking for more and better ways to write software and are willing to share them with your team.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Respect, Empathy &amp; Humility</em></strong> — you take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect, regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if you’re already a Stitch Fix superfan!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Experience working collaboratively as a team</em></strong>—we use GitHub, Heroku, Slack, Screen Hero, and Blue Jeans to get stuff done online.

It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.

IT has always been asked to do more with less, to improve its integration with business goals and to ensure the ongoing quality of IT services. With the rise of mobile technology, the cloud and an \"app\" mentality, IT is being asked to do all that and more at breakneck speed. While devices and applications are being introduced faster than ever before, it is the service behind the technology that is still most important to the customer. As a result, IT will always need to manage its services and IT Service management (ITSM) practices and processes will always be necessary. The challenge is adapting service management practices to changing times so they can enable IT to go faster and deliver more ongoing value to the customer.</p><br /><p>Processes are even more critical than before for the success of our IT organization:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>They help facilitate a common understanding of the current environment we are working in.

The VIPER team is a new, small and nimble team of world-class experts who are innovating in end-to-end video delivery.

Having a positive disposition allows us to achieve great things and to support each other.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>HELPFUL:</strong> Always looking for ways that you can help others.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>CURIOUS:</strong> It is essential that you have a passion for learning. Technology changes daily, and life has a way of constantly raising the bar.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Our clients expect us to get the right thing done on budget and on time. Communicating expectations and meeting them is the cornerstone of success.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>A FREELANCER:</strong> This means that if you live within the USA, you will also maintain your own personal client list and that Modern Tribe will only comprise a proportion of your total income. Regardless of where you live, you need to be already freelancing.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. Itâs a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionalityâ¦itâs a lot of ground to cover.

Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer.
