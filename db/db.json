Superdry focuses on offering our customers around the world innovative, premium quality and affordable clothing and accessories across menswear, womenswear and specialist ranges. Superdry customers are loyal, varied and truly global, and are defined not by their age but by their attitude.</p><br /><p>Superdry was launched in the UK in 2003 following an inspirational trip by our founders to Tokyo, and is famous for designing and producing quality garments inspired by fusing iconic vintage Americana and high-impact Japanese graphic imagery with a British twist. Our products are characterised by quality fabrics with authentic vintage washes, unique detailing, world-leading hand-drawn graphics, and tailored fits with diverse styling. As we continue to develop the breadth and nature of our product ranges, we increasingly appeal to a broader group of customers, aspirational people who want to feel amazing in what they wear and appreciate style, quality and attention to detail.</p><br /><p>We operate a fast-growing multi-channel business through a combination of standalone stores, franchised and licensed stores, concessions, ecommerce, wholesale and distributors. We are growing fastest outside of the UK and our international business is going from strength to strength. We now own and operate stores in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the USA, with franchised stores in many more countries. We have nearly 600 points of sale in over 45 different countries and are adding to this at a rate of over 50 new locations annually.

Our biggest growth area is online, where we operate ecommerce websites in over 20 different languages and ship to almost every country in the world.</p><br /><p>Our ambition for growth is summarised by our strategic plan which will provide opportunities to drive significant increases in revenue. Our plan focuses on three key areas - building a global lifestyle brand; driving awareness of the breadth of the Superdry range; and building a broad cross-channel relationship with customers. It&rsquo;s supported by the four key pillars of Embed, Enable, Extend and Execute, which define exactly how we will go about achieving our aims. As our product is at the very heart of what Superdry is all about, we are also focusing hard on our four key product attributes - design detail; quality obsession; innovation; and affordability.

It's currently a very busy team of 10. We have sales offices in Charlotte, NC, Dallas, TX and Lincoln, NE. We've been in business for 6 years and counting. The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants. Part of the job is discussing it with them and they'll tell you what the system needs to do.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/94297/machine-vision-software-engineer-artemis-vision","source":"stackoverflow","tags":["engineer","java"]},{"date":1468251093000,"title":"Full Stack Javascript Developers, Your Attention Please!","company":"Jobbatical","content":"<p>Be our web developer extraordinaire, and use your full-stack skills to help us change the world, one jobbatical at a time!</p><br /><p>We'd like to tell you this is the best jobbatical in history, but we're a bit biased.

Instead of following test instructions, you will analyse user-behaviour and test results to detect problems. You will then find root causes by combining IT skills with exploratory testing, an analytical mind and the ambition to find bugs before anyone else does. You will test all aspects of newly developed features for web-based applications to ensure that they will work on current and future browsers and operating systems. As part of a cross-functional team, you will learn to write test plans for manual and automated testing and take the lead during test meetings. You will also get the chance to work alongside developers and project owners to detect malfunctions and deliver software that is bug-free. We want someone who seeks to leave their mark on the projects they work on and who is forever considering improvements we can make or new approaches we can take. We will expect you to take an active role as you recommend design improvements or corrections throughout the development process and contribute during planning and coordination of new software releases. If you can bring the mixture of ideas, problem-solving skills and an eye-for-detail that we are looking for, we would like to hear from you.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/115790/junior-software-qa-engineer-b2b-tools-trivago","source":"stackoverflow","tags":["developer","engineer"]},{"date":1468072118000,"title":"Analytics Platform and Infrastructure Manager","company":"The Boston Consulting Group","content":"<p>PRACTICE AREA:</p><br /><p><br>The Center for Knowledge &amp; Analytics works in close collaboration with the case teams and other groups within our firm to help create, retrieve, organize, and analyze the knowledge that enables BCG to deliver superior business value for its clients.

If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><a href=\"http://tri.be/\"><strong>Modern Tribe, Inc.</strong></a> is a rapidly growing software &amp; design company. We develop custom solutions for some of the worldâs largest companies, government institutions and smaller growing organizations. We pride ourselves on our ability to bridge people and technology and to bring the passion and dedication of an entrepreneur to every project. Our team is composed of talented employees and freelancers around North &amp; South America (and a smattering across the globe).</div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div><strong>Who You Are</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We love working with each other because we have built a culture that suits us well. We work primarily with freelancers and coordinate their talents for large projects. To be on our team, you must be:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li><strong></strong><strong>HAPPY:</strong>&nbsp;Where there is a will, there is a way. Having a positive disposition allows us to achieve great things and to support each other.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>HELPFUL:</strong> Always looking for ways that you can help others.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>CURIOUS:</strong> It is essential that you have a passion for learning. Technology changes daily, and life has a way of constantly raising the bar.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Our clients expect us to get the right thing done on budget and on time. Communicating expectations and meeting them is the cornerstone of success.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>A FREELANCER:</strong> This means that if you live within the USA, you will also maintain your own personal client list and that Modern Tribe will only comprise a proportion of your total income. Regardless of where you live, you need to be already freelancing.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><div><strong><br /></strong></div><div>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. Itâs a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionalityâ¦itâs a lot of ground to cover. But weâve got an established workflow down that helps make sure weâre setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Though every project is different, hereâs the gist of our QA flow:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ol><li><strong>Kickoff meeting.</strong> Just a kickoff â meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><strong>Preparing docs.</strong> Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><strong>Review approved comps. </strong>Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, youâll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><strong>QA walkthrough.</strong> Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, youâll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><strong>Prepare QA checklist + test plan. </strong>After seeing each component of the site in action, youâll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what youâre planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><strong>Heavy duty testing. </strong>Youâll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>Celebrating a successful launch.</strong> What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ol><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Desired Personal Competencies</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Experience working as part of a remote team</li><li>Self-motivated, detail-oriented</li><li>Strong organizational skills</li><li>A methodical approach to all tasks</li><li>Ability to prioritize workloads and meet deadlines</li><li>Fluent English speaker</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Required Knowledge and Experience</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>A proven track record in manual Quality Assurance testing</li><li>A meticulous attention to detail + willingness to fight for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isnât everything â QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end userâs shoes.</li><li>A strong familiarity with WordPress; youâll be expected to prove your competence with the platform.</li><li>Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills</li><li>1+ year remote freelancing experience</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Additional Skills (Bonus Points)</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally</li><li>Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects</li><li>Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Full-time freelancers </strong>are the only candidates weâre looking for at this time; we are not seeking F/T or P/T employees, nor can we work with somebody moonlighting from a full-time gig.
