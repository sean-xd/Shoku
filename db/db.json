They take care of the code, write articles for our blog, support our customers and I handle pretty much everything else. Iâm currently looking for a Product Marketing Manager to lead all marketing and communication efforts.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>I personally review all applications myself.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Responsibilities</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>You will work directly with me to run a big part of the business. At first you will run all of your proposals by me, but once we establish trust you will operate with complete autonomy and make high level decisions on your own, reporting to me only periodically. Your responsibilities will include:</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Experimentation - Work with me to come up with creative new ideas to bring in new customers and keep existing ones. Take an idea from planning through execution and measuring results. A failed experiment isnât a loss if we learn something significant.</li><li>Blog Editor - Lead our team of developers in writing engaging content for our 10,000 email subscribers. You will have a keen eye for grammar, spelling, and clear, concise writing.</li><li>Chief Copywriter - You will hold a veto card on all public facing copy and you will absolutely love using it. You will scrutinize every bit of copy from our landing pages to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/doc/changelog/\">changelog entries</a>&nbsp;to ensure they are clear and concise.</li><li>Manage Our Ads - Analyze the performance of our ads, suggest changes, and execute those changes. You will also learn new ad platforms and experiment with them.</li><li>Site Improvements - Suggest changes to our sites to improve conversion rates and work with developers to execute on these suggestions.</li><li>Sponsorships - Suggest events, podcasts, etc to sponsor and manage those sponsorships.</li><li>Screencasts - Produce screencasts for our marketing site, blog, and documentation. You could do screencasts yourself, have another member of the team do it, or hire some help.</li><li>Promote Product Releases - Produce a blog post selling the new features and benefits in the latest version of our product and promote it via email, social media, and other channels.</li><li>Communicate with Customers - Follow up with customers who choose not to renew their subscription and compile statistics on reasons for not renewing. Survey customers for things that they need badly and that weâre in a good position to provide.</li><li>New Products - Propose new products that you would like to see us build and promote to our audience.</li><li>Communicate with Affiliates - Engage with affiliates offering them what they need to be more successful in promoting our products and earning commissions.</li><li>Build a Marketing Team - Make a case for hiring a freelance designer, developer, or another role to help you achieve your objectives. Or maybe itâs even a part-time developer you need on the team. I can be convinced.</li><li>Drip Campaigns and Marketing Automation - Use our marketing automation software (Drip) to drive engagement, decrease our bounce rates, etc.</li><li>Automated Webinars - Collaborate with developers from each of our product teams to plan, schedule, and execute a webinar. Setup automated webinar software to run it on a weekly basis.</li><li>T-Shirts - Have t-shirts designed with our branding, have a printing company do a run, and have them sent to our customers.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Requirements</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Outstanding English communication skills (spoken and written) - You need to be in the 99th percentile in spoken and written English. I canât emphasize this enough. Anything less will not do. If English is not your first language, this is going to be a tough requirement to satisfy. Applications that do not exhibit clear, concise writing will be discarded without reply.</li><li>Work hours - I usually work 8am â 4pm AST (7am â 3pm EST) from my home in Nova Scotia. Because weâll be working together a lot in the beginning, our work hours must overlap by at least 6 hours. For example, if youâre in British Columbia or Oregon you would need to start by 6am at the latest. If youâre in the UK, you would only be able to knock off at 6pm at the earliest. Once weâve been working together for a while we should be able to relax this down to as few as 2 hours of overlap.</li><li>Experience working in a marketing team - Not only have you worked in a marketing team for at least a year, but you have a solid list of achievements that demonstrate your ability to successfully lead projects. You also have a list of failures and lessons learned.</li><li>Superb organizational skills - Structure breeds creativity. You put processes in place for everything so that you have a structure to support you doing your best work.</li><li>Cares about the details - You realize that even a small tweak to copy can have a big impact. You take pride in reading through copy and making sure it meets your standards.</li><li>Owns both successes and failures - You practice Extreme Ownership. When a project youâre leading turns into a disaster, you own it. You never point the finger at others.</li><li>Self-motivated and works well independently - Meaning you donât need to be nudged every step of the way and are proactive in tackling things that need to be done without direction. You should embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it.</li><li>Comfortable working remotely - Weâre a fully remote company. We work from home, coffee shops, and co-working spaces. You must be confident that remote work is going to suit you. Ideally you have some experience working remotely.</li><li>Comfortable hanging out with a bunch of code monkeys - When we meet up in person, thereâs quite a lot of geek speak. Weâre currently 9 software developers after all. You need to be comfortable with that.</li><li>Welcomes criticism and genuinely wants to grow as a professional - Weâre big on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/team-pushes-better-developers/\">pushing each other to be better</a>. Thatâs how we grow as individuals and a team. Itâs one thing to accept criticism and another to ask for it and use it to level up.</li><li>Attend business and marketing conferences - As a tiny team, itâs important to learn from others outside the company.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Nice-to-Have</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><ul><li>Experience working remotely</li><li>Experience marketing software products</li><li>Experience with Drip marketing automation software</li><li>UX and design skills</li><li>Bachelorâs degree or equivalent</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Location Independent</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Although six of your work hours need to overlap with mine in the beginning (as mentioned above), we can do with less overlap once weâve worked together for a while.

Our team is currently distributed across the globe, working from our homes in Nova Scotia, Ontario, California, Pennsylvania, Scotland, and England.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>You Choose Your Schedule</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Whatâs your ideal schedule? Maybe you like the regular 9am-5pm schedule. Or maybe a 4-day work week is your thing. Or maybe you prefer to work 6-days per week, but less each day. Or maybe it changes week-to-week.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>It really doesnât matter as long as we overlap by six hours most days in the beginning and after a while it will be completely up to you.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>You Choose Your Benefits</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Whatâs an attractive benefits package? Well, it really depends on the person. What do you value?</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Maybe a competitive salary is what youâre after. Or maybe you really value vacation time and would rather less pay and more vacation days. Maybe health coverage is important to you, or maybe youâre already covered.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Because everyone values things differently, Iâm leaving this wide open.

A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p><br /><p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don't over-engineer and also don't under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p><br /><p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p><br /><p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies. &nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><br /><p>We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture, stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Places to Work in NYC 2013&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. &nbsp;We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you&rsquo;ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. &nbsp;So unlike most tech companies, you&rsquo;ll interact with a diverse network of people. &nbsp;After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p><br /><p>If you&rsquo;re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you&rsquo;re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p><br /><p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p><br /><p><strong>Our Company</strong></p><br /><p>Noom, Inc. is a mobile solutions company focused on preventative health.</p><br /><p>Noom's research-backed products help people achieve real, positive outcomes. Noom was awarded a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was also recently selected as one of seven healthcare startups chosen to participate in the 2014&nbsp;New York Digital Health Accelerator&nbsp;(NYDHA).</p><br /><p>Noom's apps boast more than 32&nbsp;million installs worldwide and its flagship app&nbsp;Noom Coach&nbsp;for Android has been the #1 top grossing Health and Fitness App since 2012 in the Google Play Store. Noom has offices in New York City, Berlin, Seoul and Tokyo.</p><br /><p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you&rsquo;ve got the stuff.</p><br /><p><strong>Our Products</strong></p><br /><p>At Noom we tackle some of the world&rsquo;s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. &nbsp;We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch) and fitness (GigaOm). &nbsp;More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. &nbsp;It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. &nbsp;How, you ask? &nbsp;Great question! &nbsp;It has:</p><br /><p>* A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p><br /><p>* The world&rsquo;s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p><br /><p>* Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p><br /><p>* A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p><br /><p>* Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p><br /><p><strong>Our Benefits</strong></p><br /><p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel&rsquo;s dismay). &nbsp;Because you&rsquo;ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it&rsquo;s important for you to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). &nbsp;We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).</p><br /><p>Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k). We also have a $200 wellness budget, which you can spend on everything from triathlon registration fees to massages.</p>","date":1482429649000,"location":"New York, NY","source":"stackoverflow","title":"Software Engineer","url":"http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/131537/software-engineer-noom","tags":["engineer","android","react"]},{"company":"Noom","content":"<p>Noom's scientifically proven behavior change programs take the uncertainty out of creating a healthier lifestyle, reliably delivering health outcomes, and we are tackling some of the biggest diseases out there (Type-II Diabetes, Obesity, and Hypertension to name a few).

Founded in 2012 by the people behind the Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats open source projects, Elastic's global community has more than 50,000 members across 45 countries, and since its initial release, Elastic's products have achieved more than 50 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power mission critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has over 350 employees in over 30 countries around the world.\r\n\r\nAs product adoption has soared within organizations ranging from the worldâs largest financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, government organizations like NASA, large technology firms like Adobe, Cisco, HP, IBM, Microsoft, and Salesforce, and innovative companies like BlaBlaCar, Facebook, Github, Netflix, Uber, Yelp and Wikipedia, demand for hosted and managed Elasticsearch solutions have increasingly been on the rise for developers and companies who want a cloud option.\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, Elastic launched Elasticsearch as a Service. Today, the Elastic Cloud (hosted on AWS) is the only hosted Elasticsearch product on the market supported by the creators and engineers of the Elastic Stack.

Consuming paid content should be as easy and convenient as going out to dinner: you are served first and you pay later. We want to build a user-centric product that makes users feel smart. It should represent the simplest, most secure way to buy digital goods. We want to change the way people regard paid content, turning it into a great experience.

Knowing how to build and debug complex applications is important, as well as ensuring they perform well. You understand how to test frontend applications, and how to choose and evaluate tools to help you better do your job. Oh, and having an eye for UX can be very valuable too.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Familiarity with React and its ecosystem is important - we need you to be able to hit the ground running with our existing React-based UIs. Knowledge of the Flux Application Architecture is also important. Familiarity with Redux is useful, though not mandatory.</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>A solid surface/contextual-level understanding of “the full web stack” is massively useful - we don’t expect you to know the mechanics of a DNS SOA record or the inner workings of Postgres’s HStore, but knowing the right sort of tool to use for a given task is important, as is knowing enough words to start asking helpful questions / googling the right things</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>Experience with Python would definitely be useful to be able to poke the underlying services</div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Closing date</strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>We will be taking applications until 10 January 2017.

It roughly consists of the following steps:\n\nAn initial call between you and a member of our team\nWe'll tell you more about the work that you'd be doing, and why we think Estately is a great place to work. You'll have the opportunity to ask us lots of questions, too. We'll ask you about your experience and some technical questions, mostly to get a feel for where you're at as we move forward with the process.\n\nIndividual Exercise\nWe have a few practical challenges to assess technical knowledge. Over the course of a few hours, you'll be fixing a bug in our app (that we've previously fixed), so we can see how you approach solving a realistic problem.\n\nPairing on a Few Potential Features\nFinally, during the pairing exercises you'll pair with one of our developers to implement an (existing) feature in the app. This will take a couple hours or so, and will mostly consist of discussion about approach, with some coding in the midst of it.\n\nDiversity\n\nEstately seeks to increase the ratio of women and underrepresented minorities in software engineering and development, we encourage women and people from underrepresented groups to apply for this position.\n\nEstately is striving to be a diverse team, made of and built by people with different backgrounds and lifestyles. We don't discriminate based on race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age, religion, color, or any other group.","date":1482205122000,"source":"remoteok","title":"Ruby/Full Stack Developer","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/20408","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","full stack","rails"]}],"latest":1482205122000},{"name":"Noble Digital","jobs":[{"company":"Noble Digital","content":"Noble Digital is hiring a Web Designer/Branding anywhere","date":1482200828000,"location":"","source":"dribbble","title":"Web Designer/Branding","url":"https://dribbble.com/jobs/12086?source=feed","tags":["designer"]},{"company":"Noble Digital","content":"Noble Digital is hiring a Web Designer/Branding anywhere","date":1482200828000,"source":"remoteok","title":"Web Designer Branding","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/20407","tags":["designer"]}],"latest":1482200828000},{"name":"Hylink Digital Solutions","jobs":[{"company":"Hylink Digital Solutions","content":"Hylink Digital Solutions is hiring a Senior Interactive Designer in 225 Santa Monica Blvd., 8th Floor","date":1482200507000,"location":"225 Santa Monica Blvd., 8th Floor","source":"dribbble","title":"Senior Interactive Designer","url":"https://dribbble.com/jobs/12085?source=feed","tags":["designer"]}],"latest":1482200507000},{"name":"Ellmount Interactive AB","jobs":[{"company":"Ellmount Interactive AB","content":"<p>Ellmount Interactive is expanding and looking for a Senior Frontend to strengthen our team in central Stockholm.

indices and ground plot data via machine learning processes to predict attributes about the landscape. &nbsp;The types of information that can be generated from HRIS are far-ranging from types and quality of timber resources to locations of streams, potential wildlife habitat and amount of carbon sequestration. &nbsp;The HRIS solution, creates attributes across an &nbsp;entire landscape
