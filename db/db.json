We are looking for someone who thrives on working in a variety of technology environments, and wants to build visually slick applications that have well-engineered architectures and provide a responsive user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Skills &amp; Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Who we are and what we’re doing</p>\n\n<p>As a B Corporation ( <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/azavea\">http://www.bcorporation.net/azavea</a> ), we’re committed to working on projects that have social and civic impact and advancing the state-of-the-art through research. Most of our customers are local governments, non-profit organizations and academic or federal research projects. We build custom apps; perform geospatial analysis; manage several open source civic software projects (DistrictBuilder ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/\">http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/</a> ), OpenTreeMap ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/\">http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/</a> ) and others ( <a href=\"http://github.com/azavea/\">http://github.com/azavea/</a> )); and develop an open source, high performance computing framework, GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io\">https://geotrellis.io</a> ), that enables us to build fast analytical applications by distributing the geospatial data processing. Our developers work across the technology stack from database and application servers in the infrastructure layer to modern, browser-based front-ends.</p>\n\n<p>The Geospatial Insights Team</p>\n\n<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data. The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product teams or professional services teams. The Geospatial Insights team works on a couple of custom software projects, but its current primary focus is on developing three leading edge SaaS products: HunchLab ( <a href=\"http://www.hunchlab.com/\">http://www.hunchlab.com/</a> ), a web application for forecasting of geographic crime risk; Raster Foundry, a toolkit for processing aerial and satellite imagery at scale; and ModelLab, a spatial data processing framework. HunchLab is sold as a SaaS product to law enforcement agencies and applies a mix of clever software, statistics, machine learning and AWS clusters to create a powerful analysis tool that is being used to improve public safety in communities around the world. The other two products are just beginning development and are funded by research grants from the US Department of Energy and NASA, respectively. The Geospatial Insights team is particularly strong with Javascript, Python, R, Scala, Spark, PostgreSQL, and architecting solutions for the AWS platform.</p>\n\n<p>With the new research grants, we are looking to grow the team, and we need your help to scale up our development capacity.</p>\n\n<p>What You’ll Do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement application code, APIs and web or mobile clients based on wireframes and designs developed by our UI/UX Design team. </li>\n<li>Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to database design, architecture, development, testing and deployment. </li>\n<li>Optimize database, server and client performance to create applications with both functional and responsive user experiences. </li>\n<li>Build, provision, and deploy servers in a repeatable way to AWS. </li>\n<li>Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to build and support scalable web applications in Python/Django, or another MVC framework (C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, Java/JVM/Spring, Scala/Play). We do a lot of work in Python/Django, Javascript, and Scala and dabble in others depending on client and project requirements. </li>\n<li>Demonstrate fluency in core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and contemporary Javascript libraries like jQuery, React, or AngularJS. </li>\n<li>Express solid understanding of MVC architecture, RESTful design patterns, and the DRY principle. </li>\n<li>Be comfortable managing VMs and working in a Linux environment. </li>\n<li>Be interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects. </li>\n<li>Get excited about a diversity of both projects and technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get extra points for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background in math and statistics or experience with R. </li>\n<li>Experience with open source or commercial geospatial toolkits like OpenLayers, Leaflet, GeoServer, PostGIS, CartoDB, ArcGIS, and GoogleMaps. </li>\n<li>Experience with mobile apps (Objective C, Android or responsive HTML). </li>\n<li>Experience scaling apps within AWS. </li>\n<li>Experience provisioning servers with Ansible. </li>\n<li>Knowledge of distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc. </li>\n<li>Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we don’t say “X-Y years of experience” or “M.S. in Computer Science.” Formal credentials like these are not irrelevant, but we are primarily looking for people who have had experience successfully building sophisticated web applications. You might have had these kinds of experiences without a college degree. Or you may be just out of school but worked your way through school and had some great co-op experiences. Or you might have a math or humanities background but a have a great head for software development. These are all potentially great backgrounds, and we’d be interested in hearing from you.</p>\n\n<p>Office and Benefits</p>\n\n<p>Our Philadelphia office is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, a shower and lockers. It’s an open office plan with several smaller rooms for team meetings, private space and concentration time. You get a top-end Linux workstation, Mac or Windows laptop with a pile of memory for VMs and extra monitors. We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule. After the first six months, our developers can also spend up to 10% of their time on a geospatial open source, professional development, or R&amp;D project. For example, some of our colleagues are contributors to the PostGIS ( <a href=\"http://postgis.refractions.net/\">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a> ), OpenLayers ( <a href=\"http://openlayers.org/\">http://openlayers.org/</a> ), GDAL ( <a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/\">http://www.gdal.org/</a> ) and GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io/\">https://geotrellis.io/</a> ) projects. Other research projects have included improving dev ops tool chains; using FFT ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform</a> ) for fast kernel density estimation ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density</a> ); working with Spark to develop machine learning tools; and using GPUs for faster raster data processing. Once a quarter, we all get together to share our research and learning with our colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/\">http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/</a> ) that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children </li>\n<li>Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance </li>\n<li>Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not </li>\n<li>Retirement plan with matching percentage </li>\n<li>Almost 4 weeks paid vacation plus additional paid sick/personal time off </li>\n<li>Family and medical leave </li>\n<li>Flexible work schedule </li>\n<li>Paid maternity and paternity leave </li>\n<li>Child care subsidy </li>\n<li>Paid time off for voting and volunteering </li>\n<li>Education assistance plan </li>\n<li>Student loan assistance </li>\n<li>Public transit and biking reimbursement plans </li>\n<li>Monthly guest lectures with lunches on the house </li>\n<li>10% time for Research or Training Projects </li>\n<li>Profit-sharing bonus plan </li>\n<li>Financial transparency through an open book policy </li>\n<li>Kind, capable and thoughtful colleagues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We welcome qualified candidates from all walks of life and value diversity in our company, and we prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status, military service, disability unrelated to job requirements, marital status, or domestic partner status.</p>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/f95be01e-871e-11e6-8958-59c1698d958d","source":"github","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","aws","rails","python","android","react","angular",".net","java"]}],"latest":1475247815000},{"name":"Skuid","jobs":[{"date":1475247387000,"title":"Technical Curriculum Developer and Instructor","company":"Skuid","content":"<p>We are looking for talented individuals with curriculum development and instruction experience for a technical audience in Walnut Creek, CA or Chattanooga, TN.&nbsp; As part of the User Assistance and Training team, you will be responsible for educating customers, partners, prospects, and employees on how to use and become proficient at Skuid.

Our specialty is communicating user experience. Awesome visual &amp; interaction design is a starting point. Communicating that design amongst ourselves, and most importantly to the clients, is key to our success.<br><br>This role would primarily involve visual &amp; interaction design across a broad set of projects. Our clients range from enterprise to consumer, Fortune 500 to unfunded start-ups.

Broad UX skill-sets are a must. We specialize in complexity, whether that is in the product itself, the domain, user population, idea, actual design, etc. Deeply understanding our client&#x2019;s needs and reducing it to the compellingly simple is a common thread of our work. <br><br>While &quot;visual &amp; interaction design&quot; is the label for the primary role, we very much understand the Hunting the Unicorn conundrum (search for that and Design Staff, Google Ventures, if you haven&apos;t read that great blog).

But this is just the beginning.</p><br /><p><strong>The good bits:</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be one of the first full-time employees at Teacup (we went live in March 2016), so there&rsquo;s plenty of room to add your charm and direction to the company.</p><br /><p>Eventually, you&rsquo;ll be working with a great team to compliment your strengths. As the team grows, your role will too, if that&rsquo;s what you want.</p><br /><p>Work from anywhere - there&rsquo;s no office, so you can work where you feel happiest.</p><br /><p><strong>The challenging bits:</strong></p><br /><p>As our first dedicated front-end developer, you&rsquo;ll be in charge of the web UI. This means bridging our awesome designs and sophisticated backend functionality to produce a simple, beautiful and reliable user experience.</p><br /><p>In addition, you will be responsible for the architecture of the front-end code, both existing and new. Prepare to dive in and start a combination of new feature build and continuous optimisation of existing code. Your passion for a great user experience will be called on.</p><br /><p>As a modern startup, we aim to have complete test coverage. However, our existing front-end code has been in too much flux due to rapid feature build to justify this. We are now moving into a more stable development phase, so you&rsquo;ll be expected to write tests for all new code, and existing untested code over time.</p><br /><p>Because we work with skilled designers, you do not need to be a graphic design expert. However, you will need to be able to work with existing and new HTML and CSS from our designer, and produce some of your own.</p><br /><p><strong>The basic bits:</strong></p><br /><p>This is a full time role.</p><br /><p>Competitive compensation with payment in dollars.</p>","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/19273","source":"remoteok","tags":["developer","designer"]}],"latest":1475085155000},{"name":"AccuPoint","jobs":[{"date":1475084705000,"title":"Junior Software Engineer","company":"AccuPoint","content":"AccuPoint is currently seeking a dynamic Software Engineer to join its team&#13;\n​&#13;\n&#13;\nWho you are:&#13;\n​The developer we are looking for is hungry and excited to thrive in a fast paced en...","url":"http://jobs.smashingmagazine.com/j/Junior-Software-Engineer/2429530","source":"smashingjobs","tags":["developer","engineer"]},{"date":1474924722000,"title":"Freelance Front End Developer","company":"AccuPoint","content":"About Us&#13;\n&#13;\nAccuPoint is a web based health care and human services practice management platform that streamlines scheduling, payroll, insurance billing, and compliance for Home and Community ...","url":"http://jobs.smashingmagazine.com/j/Freelance-Front-End-Developer/2428713","source":"smashingjobs","tags":["developer"]}],"latest":1475084705000},{"name":"SiteZeus","jobs":[{"date":1475084652000,"title":"Full Stack Web Developer and Big Data/Machine Learning","company":"SiteZeus","content":"<p>SiteZeus is a fast-growing startup disrupting the way growing companies select new locations with Predictive Analytics based on big data and machine learning.&nbsp; We are seeking the best &amp; brightest engineers to join our Product Development team to enhance our award-winning product suite.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/125725/full-stack-web-developer-and-big-data-machine-sitezeus","source":"stackoverflow","location":"Tampa, FL","tags":["developer","engineer","full stack"]},{"date":1475084652000,"title":"Full Stack Web Developer Big Data Machine Learning","company":"SiteZeus","content":"<p>SiteZeus is a fast-growing startup disrupting the way growing companies select new locations with Predictive Analytics based on big data and machine learning.&nbsp; We are seeking the best &amp; brightest engineers to join our Product Development team to enhance our award-winning product suite.</p>","url":"https://remoteok.io/l/19264","source":"remoteok","tags":["developer","engineer","full stack"]}],"latest":1475084652000},{"name":"MakerBot","jobs":[{"date":1475084175000,"title":"Embedded GUI Software Engineer","company":"MakerBot","content":"<p>MakerBot is looking for a Embedded Engineer to design and develop the 3D printers that are changing the way people work and create. &nbsp;We are looking for an embedded software engineer who has experience in embedded GUI development. &nbsp;Our software engineers are constantly working on brand new problems, are picking up new skills all the time, and have a direct impact on the direction of the products we build.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/123883/embedded-gui-software-engineer-makerbot","source":"stackoverflow","location":"Brooklyn, NY","tags":["engineer"]},{"date":1474990542000,"title":"Mobile App Engineer","company":"MakerBot","content":"<p><strong>Mobile App Engineer</strong></p><br /><p>Design and develop software for the 3D printers and scanners that are changing the way people work and create.

Symphony's front-end web application uses the modular pattern made popular in CommonJS, which builds each component as a loosely coupled anonymous closure. The core of the JavaScript app handles request transport details, new message notifications and updates, configuration of the UI layout, and much more. These functions are abstracted behind a public sandbox and selectively bundled into modules when the components are loaded. This architecture helps Symphony add new components quickly and seamlessly because they are isolated from each other, and lets developers control exactly how much of the app needs to load—an architecture specifically designed for integration and customization.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>ABOUT SYMPHONY:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span>Established in September 2014 after raising $66 million from 15 of the world’s largest financial institutions, Symphony is a secure, cloud-based workflow platform helping individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes improve their productivity while maintaining data security and regulatory compliance.

Beyond just hitting buttons, youâll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what weâre doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><strong>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.&nbsp;</strong>What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and â most importantly â the client will be happy. It doesnât get much better than that.</li></ul><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.<strong></strong></div><div class=\"paragraph_break\"><br /></div><div><strong>Location</strong><br /></div><div>Work from anywhere in the&nbsp;<strong>US or Canada</strong>; if you are in&nbsp;<strong>Central or South America</strong>, letâs talk.

We&#39;re hiring a designer. This is a full-time, salaried position on the mighty Cotton Bureau squad. We&#39;re not actually sure what to call this position specifically, because, well, our industry isn&#39;t quite sure what to call it either. Web designer. Interface designer. UI designer. UX designer. Experience designer. Digital designer. Front-end designer. Ugh...maybe it&#39;s just easier if we explain who we&#39;re looking for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s who we’re looking for…</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You’re someone who knows modern interface design in your bones, and you’ve spent the last 3–5 years proving it. To us that means design systems and pattern libraries, marketing sites, dashboards, onboarding flows, icons, and maybe even illustration/graphics, branding/identity, and app design.</li>\n<li>You not only sweat the details, you sweat through your shirt. Seriously though, we tend to look at our product design from 10,000 feet. We need someone who comes equipped with a jeweler’s loupe.</li>\n<li>Chances are, you’ve been on a larger design team at a startup/service/company/agency recently, but wherever you’ve been, you’re ready to make a bigger difference at a smaller company. We want someone to really own this (besides one of our co-founders, you’ll be the only other designer on the team for a while).</li>\n<li>Maybe you’re not exactly a Designer Who Can Code™, but you’re at least capable of turning your designs into live prototypes of some fidelity. But hey, if you can crank out production-ready code, even better.</li>\n<li>We have a tendency to fly by the seat of our pants when it comes to product design, so you’re either comfortable with that, or you’re someone who can whip our process into shape.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re a small company, so there are a lot of opportunities to design things...everything mentioned above plus packaging, signage, even our new office (coming early 2017). This excites you, it doesn&#39;t scare you away.</li>\n<li>You’re in Pittsburgh, near Pittsburgh, or at least Pittsburgh-curious. We’re not totally out on remote employees, but candidates who are willing to consider moving here have a leg up.</li>\n<li>Bonus points for: writing ability, experience managing direct reports (or the desire to eventually lead a team), a working understanding of screen printing or garment production.</li>\n<li>Fake bonus points for: an interesting hobby, a cute pet, being funny on Twitter, talking incessantly about food, winning a fantasy football league.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s who we are…</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are a ton of crappy make-me-a-t-shirt websites on the internet, but we’re not one of them.

That sounds trite, but it’s why we stand out. <a href=\"https://atlarge.cottonbureau.com/\">You can read more about our story and principles here</a>.</li>\n<li>We’re a three-year-old profitable company with a real business model.

Despite their success, we shut both down years ago to focus on growing Cotton Bureau.</li>\n<li>We’re pretty small in the grand scheme of things (seven people full-time).</li>\n<li>We’re proudly located in Pittsburgh, PA, and we’re not moving.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Here’s what you get…</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A fair salary.</li>\n<li>A new computer.</li>\n<li>Access to our company healthcare plan.</li>\n<li>Generous time off and holidays.</li>\n<li>Free parking, if you’re the driving-a-car type.</li>\n<li>Relocation assistance if you’re not in or near Pittsburgh.</li>\n<li>All the cool t-shirts that&#39;ll fit in your closet.</li>\n<li>If you need a bunch of fancy Bay Area perks like free lunch and a ping-pong table to do your job, we can’t help ya (though we&#39;re at least considering a ping-pong table).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Cotton Bureau provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, national origin, age, disability or genetics.

Your&nbsp;goal should be the best solution over&nbsp;anything&nbsp;else.&nbsp;The&nbsp;UX&nbsp;team&nbsp;at Tenable uses&nbsp;the word &ldquo;we&rdquo;&nbsp;rather than &ldquo;I&rdquo; as&nbsp;much as possible.&nbsp;That&nbsp;is&nbsp;because&nbsp;all of our&nbsp;designers, engineers&nbsp;and product teams&nbsp;influence the design&mdash;not&nbsp;just&nbsp;the&nbsp;designer.

You can explain each piece of an interaction and write&nbsp;specifications&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;engineers.</p><br /><p>Your&nbsp;organization&nbsp;skills&nbsp;are unmatched. We work&nbsp;hard to create transparency&nbsp;with all of our work.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;team&nbsp;shares&nbsp;everything and has&nbsp;a zero&shy;-ownership mentality.

We believe that great designers&nbsp;are also great communicators. But,&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;being&nbsp;a&nbsp;great communicator&nbsp;is&nbsp;also being a great listener. Your speaking, presenting,&nbsp;and&nbsp;listening&nbsp;skills&nbsp;should be top notch.</p><br /><p>You&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;let&nbsp;your&nbsp;experience, title, or&nbsp;talents&nbsp;go to your&nbsp;head.

We're aiming to aggregate logistics data enabling customers to operate more efficiently and connect them with other logistics companies. We believe we're on to something big, but to get there we're working through complex problems in a complex domain. We're attacking those problems with an unconventional approach (event sourcing with a twist) and dealing with big data to boot. This isn't a run of the mill MVC app. Because of this complexity, we're limiting our search to two kinds of people: experienced engineers who can bring structure to the chaos as we grow, or those applicants who can make up for lack of experience with passion and creativity. Please don't apply unless you can demonstrate one of these somehow.</p><br /><p><strong>A little about us</strong></p><br /><p>We are not a typical startup. We're the skunkworks offshoot of an existing logistics company - we founded this startup to address logistics challenges we've faced since we started that company nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our competitors face the same problems, and the industry at large isn't making much progress to solve them. So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy haired boss. We believe in solid development practices that avoid technical debt, and want to focus on product quality above all else. We also believe in independence and accountability - I'm not looking to add 'babysitter' to my job description.</p><br /><p>We've been trying to tackle these problems in some fashion for many years, but development only really picked up in the last year. Right now we've got a remote team of 10, but we're looking to build a local team here in Chicago - the complex nature of the problems and the domain means we're really going to benefit from having a solid core group with lots of facetime.</p><br /><p><strong>Our stack</strong></p><br /><p>Primarily C#.

The business is growing and so we need another engineer to join us. Given the size of the place we all end up doing a lot of different things and you'll be handed a lot of responsibility from day one. You'll discuss solutions with clients directly, and then go about implementing them. All the solutions we build accomplish very real world goals and solve real world problems of parts on production lines. &nbsp;It's a very tangible job, solving \"how it's made\" for our customers. &nbsp;We want somebody who looks to grow a business and deliver great solutions. We want people who are able to fully focus on building the best systems and solutions, yet also pragmatic and flexible enough to work for a small company.<br> <br> *What we do:<br> <br> We put in machine vision solutions throughout North America. Solutions are programmed here in Denver and then installed at the client site. We also program and license machine vision software and systems other companies install. We've been working on building a portfolio of standard products.<br> <br> We're looking for fellow programmers who like machine vision and building systems from the ground up to exacting levels of quality. Because machine vision often moves into industrial automation, we end up communicating with a lot of embedded devices and dealing with some robotics and motion control. Skills with PLCs are a plus as are database skills (Oracle, MS SQL, MariaDB, etc.). We're programmers ourselves so we certainly understand skills in C++ transfer to C# or Java and vice versa. Every project is very different, and we need people who enjoy challenges and seeing if a given industrial puzzle can be solved and then pursuing that solution to a solid and reliable system.<br> <br> In general most projects are programmed by 1-2 people so there's generally little bureaucracy around interfaces. Typically the system will have 1-4 users at a factory and you'll know them by name so there's no guessing about what the hypothetical \"user\" wants.
