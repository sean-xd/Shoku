We are looking for someone who thrives on working in a variety of technology environments, and wants to build visually slick applications that have well-engineered architectures and provide a responsive user experience.</p>\n\n<p>Skills &amp; Requirements</p>\n\n<p>Who we are and what we’re doing</p>\n\n<p>As a B Corporation ( <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/azavea\">http://www.bcorporation.net/azavea</a> ), we’re committed to working on projects that have social and civic impact and advancing the state-of-the-art through research. Most of our customers are local governments, non-profit organizations and academic or federal research projects. We build custom apps; perform geospatial analysis; manage several open source civic software projects (DistrictBuilder ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/\">http://www.azavea.com/districtbuilder/</a> ), OpenTreeMap ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/\">http://www.azavea.com/opentreemap/</a> ) and others ( <a href=\"http://github.com/azavea/\">http://github.com/azavea/</a> )); and develop an open source, high performance computing framework, GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io\">https://geotrellis.io</a> ), that enables us to build fast analytical applications by distributing the geospatial data processing. Our developers work across the technology stack from database and application servers in the infrastructure layer to modern, browser-based front-ends.</p>\n\n<p>The Geospatial Insights Team</p>\n\n<p>Azavea has five software teams, all of which develop web software for processing and visualizing geospatial data. The teams differ in terms of the specific projects they develop and whether they are primarily product teams or professional services teams. The Geospatial Insights team works on a couple of custom software projects, but its current primary focus is on developing three leading edge SaaS products: HunchLab ( <a href=\"http://www.hunchlab.com/\">http://www.hunchlab.com/</a> ), a web application for forecasting of geographic crime risk; Raster Foundry, a toolkit for processing aerial and satellite imagery at scale; and ModelLab, a spatial data processing framework. HunchLab is sold as a SaaS product to law enforcement agencies and applies a mix of clever software, statistics, machine learning and AWS clusters to create a powerful analysis tool that is being used to improve public safety in communities around the world. The other two products are just beginning development and are funded by research grants from the US Department of Energy and NASA, respectively. The Geospatial Insights team is particularly strong with Javascript, Python, R, Scala, Spark, PostgreSQL, and architecting solutions for the AWS platform.</p>\n\n<p>With the new research grants, we are looking to grow the team, and we need your help to scale up our development capacity.</p>\n\n<p>What You’ll Do:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement application code, APIs and web or mobile clients based on wireframes and designs developed by our UI/UX Design team. </li>\n<li>Engage in multidisciplinary work that applies an agile process (scrum board, daily stand-ups and two-week iterations) to database design, architecture, development, testing and deployment. </li>\n<li>Optimize database, server and client performance to create applications with both functional and responsive user experiences. </li>\n<li>Build, provision, and deploy servers in a repeatable way to AWS. </li>\n<li>Contribute to both a growing company and to the open source communities that support our work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to build and support scalable web applications in Python/Django, or another MVC framework (C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, Java/JVM/Spring, Scala/Play). We do a lot of work in Python/Django, Javascript, and Scala and dabble in others depending on client and project requirements. </li>\n<li>Demonstrate fluency in core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) and contemporary Javascript libraries like jQuery, React, or AngularJS. </li>\n<li>Express solid understanding of MVC architecture, RESTful design patterns, and the DRY principle. </li>\n<li>Be comfortable managing VMs and working in a Linux environment. </li>\n<li>Be interested in working with a small, collaborative team on meaningful projects. </li>\n<li>Get excited about a diversity of both projects and technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get extra points for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background in math and statistics or experience with R. </li>\n<li>Experience with open source or commercial geospatial toolkits like OpenLayers, Leaflet, GeoServer, PostGIS, CartoDB, ArcGIS, and GoogleMaps. </li>\n<li>Experience with mobile apps (Objective C, Android or responsive HTML). </li>\n<li>Experience scaling apps within AWS. </li>\n<li>Experience provisioning servers with Ansible. </li>\n<li>Knowledge of distributed data processing frameworks, like Hadoop, Amazon MR, etc. </li>\n<li>Demonstrating your open source or other community service contributions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we don’t say “X-Y years of experience” or “M.S. in Computer Science.” Formal credentials like these are not irrelevant, but we are primarily looking for people who have had experience successfully building sophisticated web applications. You might have had these kinds of experiences without a college degree. Or you may be just out of school but worked your way through school and had some great co-op experiences. Or you might have a math or humanities background but a have a great head for software development. These are all potentially great backgrounds, and we’d be interested in hearing from you.</p>\n\n<p>Office and Benefits</p>\n\n<p>Our Philadelphia office is located in a brightly lit office on the 5th floor of a converted factory building in the Callowhill neighborhood, a short walk from Center City, the Reading Terminal Market and SEPTA subway and regional rail stations. For bicyclists, we have in-house bike parking, a shower and lockers. It’s an open office plan with several smaller rooms for team meetings, private space and concentration time. You get a top-end Linux workstation, Mac or Windows laptop with a pile of memory for VMs and extra monitors. We have flex-time to deal with personal stuff, and most people work a 40 - 45 hour week on a regular schedule. After the first six months, our developers can also spend up to 10% of their time on a geospatial open source, professional development, or R&amp;D project. For example, some of our colleagues are contributors to the PostGIS ( <a href=\"http://postgis.refractions.net/\">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a> ), OpenLayers ( <a href=\"http://openlayers.org/\">http://openlayers.org/</a> ), GDAL ( <a href=\"http://www.gdal.org/\">http://www.gdal.org/</a> ) and GeoTrellis ( <a href=\"https://geotrellis.io/\">https://geotrellis.io/</a> ) projects. Other research projects have included improving dev ops tool chains; using FFT ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform</a> ) for fast kernel density estimation ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density</a> ); working with Spark to develop machine learning tools; and using GPUs for faster raster data processing. Once a quarter, we all get together to share our research and learning with our colleagues.</p>\n\n<p>We offer a salary commensurate with skills and experience and a benefits package ( <a href=\"http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/\">http://www.azavea.com/about-us/join-us/benefits/</a> ) that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fully subsidized health care, dental, prescription plan, including for spouse/partner and children </li>\n<li>Fully subsidized life and long term disability insurance, plus voluntary short term disability insurance </li>\n<li>Medical reimbursement plan to cover what the health insurance does not </li>\n<li>Retirement plan with matching percentage </li>\n<li>Almost 4 weeks paid vacation plus additional paid sick/personal time off </li>\n<li>Family and medical leave </li>\n<li>Flexible work schedule </li>\n<li>Paid maternity and paternity leave </li>\n<li>Child care subsidy </li>\n<li>Paid time off for voting and volunteering </li>\n<li>Education assistance plan </li>\n<li>Student loan assistance </li>\n<li>Public transit and biking reimbursement plans </li>\n<li>Monthly guest lectures with lunches on the house </li>\n<li>10% time for Research or Training Projects </li>\n<li>Profit-sharing bonus plan </li>\n<li>Financial transparency through an open book policy </li>\n<li>Kind, capable and thoughtful colleagues</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We welcome qualified candidates from all walks of life and value diversity in our company, and we prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status, military service, disability unrelated to job requirements, marital status, or domestic partner status.</p>\n","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/f95be01e-871e-11e6-8958-59c1698d958d","source":"github","tags":["javascript","developer","engineer","aws","rails","python","android","react","angular",".net","java"]}],"latest":1475247815000},{"name":"Arrowsight","jobs":[{"date":1475246482000,"title":"SQL Server Engineer","company":"Arrowsight","content":"<p>Are you passionate about SQL Server programming, data modeling, and database reliability? &nbsp;Come join us!</p><br /><p>You'll be developing and revamping databases&nbsp;and back-end scripts that enable us to analyze thousands of video segments every day.

We have the flexibility to choose the technology that does the job best. Exciting challenges at huge scale and high speed!</p><br />We want engineers that are challenged by complex problems in distributed environments, but value simplicity in their solutions. We want software designers that look at the entire system and think like engineers - you look for data to validate your assumptions, you create tests to verify your implementations, you know your tools, and you look for opportunities to automate everything. You are a coder that wants to learn how all the parts work together - you want to know what it takes to run your code securely in a global production environment as much as you care about writing and debugging it.<p><br /><strong>If this is you or who you want to be, we want to hear from you:</strong></p><br />You are a computer science professional with a passion for revealing potential security weaknesses and for crafting creative solutions to eliminate those weaknesses. Your skills will be the foundation of security initiatives that protect the security and privacy of over a billion people. You will build and deploy large, distributed security solutions, and we will rely on you to provide our engineering teams with the security expertise necessary to make confident system design decisions.<p><br />You have a M.Sc in Computer Science or equivalent experience with building large-scale distributed systems in various programming languages. You have extensive knowledge of internet security threads and security issues, and are an advocate for secure software engineering practices that wants to take a leading role in driving internal security and privacy initiatives. You are excited by analyzing, assessing and responding to security issues, and make sure that potential breaches are detected and handled effectively. You want to continuously improve automated detection systems to surface vulnerabilities before they become threats. You enjoy working directly with the security community, any maybe you have published or presented relevant research at conferences or in blogs.</p><br />We develop our software mostly in Java, run our services primarily in AWS, manage our code in git and drive our continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins. We don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;ve used the technologies we&rsquo;re currently working with before. We DO care that you think they&rsquo;re cool and something you want to work with.<p><br />We want smart people who will fight for their point of view because we&rsquo;re often wrong, we just don&rsquo;t like admitting it. We want co-workers who want to constantly learn new things and are capable of fluidly moving between projects. We want teammates who can quickly become subject matter experts in new areas and share that knowledge with the team and with the company. We want colleagues who take pride in what they do and want to share it with the world. We want engineers who are excited by contributing to open source projects, writing blog posts and speaking at conferences. We want people who want to dive into projects supporting Telenor&rsquo;s business units all over the world.</p><br />If you are not certain whether you should apply or not, see how many of the statements below you can agree with.

Our specialty is communicating user experience. Awesome visual &amp; interaction design is a starting point. Communicating that design amongst ourselves, and most importantly to the clients, is key to our success.<br><br>This role would primarily involve visual &amp; interaction design across a broad set of projects. Our clients range from enterprise to consumer, Fortune 500 to unfunded start-ups. Products include software apps, mobile apps, websites, technical tools, hardware, medical devices, services, spaces, public transportation, asteroids (yes, asteroids), and more. Broad UX skill-sets are a must. We specialize in complexity, whether that is in the product itself, the domain, user population, idea, actual design, etc. Deeply understanding our client&#x2019;s needs and reducing it to the compellingly simple is a common thread of our work. <br><br>While &quot;visual &amp; interaction design&quot; is the label for the primary role, we very much understand the Hunting the Unicorn conundrum (search for that and Design Staff, Google Ventures, if you haven&apos;t read that great blog).

The Program is strongly connected to the international academic community, placing emphasis on transdisciplinary synergies and applied approaches.

In addition, the ESM Program has been invited to participate in numerous policy-oriented consultations and large scale scientific exercises.</p><br /><p>Accurate and reliable spatially explicit information on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, and in particular its anthropogenic use, is at the crux of our need to understand our changing planet and to be able to create biophysical and economic models with reliable input and calibration data.

Hence the <a href=\"http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/EcosystemsServicesandManagement/EOS.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth Observation Systems (EOS) Research Group</a> has built and deployed tools and platforms to use citizen science, crowdsourcing and expert knowledge in order to improve in-situ data and the overall information base of land cover and land use globally via product integration and geospatial approaches.</p><br /><p>The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform and community to generate, share and utilize information on land, soil and water resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a longstanding challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge.</p>","url":"https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/124988/mobile-app-developer-international-institute-for","source":"stackoverflow","location":"IIASA","tags":["developer"]}],"latest":1473950337000},{"name":"Index Exchange","jobs":[{"date":1473949215000,"title":"Integrations Engineer","company":"Index Exchange","content":"<p>Operating within our nascent Professional Services team, we&rsquo;re looking for an Associate Technical Consultant/Integrations Engineer who will manage and execute the entire integrations life-cycle including planning, discovery, design, configuration, testing and deployment in addition to project and client management responsibilities.

Steeds meer taken worden gedecentraliseerd, terwijl tegelijkertijd de middelen afnemen. Publieke spelers en marktpartijen raken steeds meer verweven en de overheid vraagt meer eigen verantwoordelijkheid en zelfredzaamheid van de burger. De overheid zal dienstverlening regisseren in plaats van die helemaal zelf te leveren, en zal maatschappelijke initiatieven vanuit de burger en de markt steeds meer faciliteren.<br>PinkRoccade Local Government biedt overheidsorganisaties een integraal platform voor gegevenslogistiek &amp; informatievoorziening met de naam Makelaarsuite. Makelaarsuite biedt gemeenten alle benodigde functionaliteit om gegevens over burgers en bedrijven uit te wisselen tussen de gemeentelijke afdelingen en met externe organisaties zoals waterschappen, belastingkantoren en Jeugdzorg. De toegevoegde waarde van Makelaarsuite is dat gemeenten altijd in staat zijn gebruik te maken van de juiste en actuele gegevens, waardoor de kwaliteit van de dienstverlening naar burgers en bedrijven toeneemt. Makelaarsuite biedt daarnaast functionaliteit om gegevens om te zetten in informatie. Dit gebeurt met behulp van business intelligence achtige analyses, linked data toepassingen en in de toekomst ook big data. Met de informatie die gemeenten via Makelaarsuite beschikbaar hebben kunnen zij processen als handhaving verbeteren of bijvoorbeeld beleid maken dat beter aansluit bij de wensen van de burgers in de gemeente.
