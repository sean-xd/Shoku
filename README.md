#Shoku - Daily Tech Jobs
Shoku is a tech job aggregator. It currently gets jobs from:

* Github
* StackOverflow
* wfh.io
* We Work Remotely
* Remote Ok
* Coroflot

The latest 200 results are sent to the client and paged by 10 with pseudo-infinite scroll.

##Technology Used
It's a web application so HTML5, CSS3, ES6.

I used Angular because it makes certain MVP features a lot simpler.

I intend to replace Angular with native ES6 once MVP is complete.
